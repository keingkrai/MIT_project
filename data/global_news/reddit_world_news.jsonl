These options were actually down very bad during liberation day, which is what caused me to double down and put another 25k into the GOOGL LEAPS you see here. So I'd like to thank 🥭 for giving us such a fantastic entry point.\n\nI told myself I wouldn't sell anything until my original $33,000 position either hit 1M or I was getting LTCG, and today I reached the 1M milestone so allowed myself to lock in some gains on my shortest expiration positions.\n\nI want to have it on record that everybody called me an idiot for holding onto these when GOOGL was at 285 last month.\n\nRemaining position attached. I still have high conviction in the GOOGL/QQQ trade. Compared to its peers, GOOGL is still obviously undervalued, the only risk I see is market risk so have opened some index puts to hedge.\n\nLast time I posted I had 20 people in my DMs asking regarded ass for advice so I'll put the only advice I have here so you stop spamming me:\n\n1. Do not manage your portfolio daily, manage it monthly at most. **Every time you buy OR sell an option you are losing money to the market makers.** Everybody on here will give advice to \"lock in gains\" or \"roll to a new position\" if you're up, when in reality you're bleeding money to hedge fund algorithms every time you make any trade at all. Trading options at all is inherently a losing game, but if you want to minimize the money you pay to market makers, simply make fewer trades. If you start with 1k and put it into options: imagine paying like 3-10% of that to market makers every time you reinvest it (on average) — so if you reinvest the same money 5 times, you are essentially 'paying' 15-40% of your expected value to algorithms/market makers. I sometimes think that the hedge funds themselves are in this sub astroturfing to get people to trade daily because it's so profitable for them.\n2. Human emotion is your greatest weakness. There are algorithms that are literally designed to manipulate retail traders into panic buying or selling. **If you ever want to make a trade, WAIT 24H** and if you still want to do it the next day, go for it. Retail traders never have knowledge before the big funds, so there is NEVER a rush to make a trade. Rushing will only hurt you.", "score": 3824, "num_comments": 246, "over_18": false, "author": "trentcoolyak"}

Suddenly every headline is about Google’s TPUs, Meta “considering alternatives,” AI spending fears, bubble warnings, all dropping at the exact same time. It feels like the entire narrative suddenly shifted away from Nvidia’s actual results toward boosting Google’s storyline.\n\nThe confusing part is that Google’s TPU ecosystem isn’t even close to replacing Nvidia at scale today. Not even remotely. But the fear was enough to push NVDA down like it’s some tiny speculative stock.\n\nThis is the company powering the entire AI boom. This is the hardware that every major AI model is running on. And somehow the market decides now is the moment to punish it?\n\nIt makes no sense.\n\nYet the selloff is happening, and because Nvidia is one of the heaviest weights in QQQ, SPY, and the whole semiconductor sector, the drop is pulling the entire market down with it. If this keeps going, it’s the kind of move that can trigger a chain reaction across the indices. Everything follows NVDA right now.\n\nThe timing of all this is what feels weird. Google pushes TPU hype, the media instantly amplifies it, NVDA tanks, Google rallies, and suddenly the entire market trades like something catastrophic happened, even though fundamentally nothing changed in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt doesn’t look like normal price action. It looks like someone flipped the sentiment switch.\n\nNvidia didn’t lose half a trillion in real value. It lost confidence because the story was yanked away from its earnings and redirected somewhere else.\n\nThe big question is whether this spiral continues and drags the whole market down with it, or whether NVDA stabilizes once people realize the fundamentals didn’t suddenly collapse.\n\nCurious what others think.

Google used its own processors *(TPUs)* and not Nvidia chips to train the Gemini 3 model. This means Google has just leapfrogged OpenAI in the competition, and the structural advantages are now becoming evident.\n\n* Google has 4 billion users across Search, YouTube, and Gmail who generate valuable training data for their models. Compared to this, all the data OpenAI uses must either be scraped from the web *(which raises copyright issues)* or acquired from other companies *(which worsens their margins)*.\n\n\n\n* The TPUs that Google used for training their latest model are designed by Google itself and integrated directly into Google’s data centers. While there are rumors that TPUs are better for machine learning workloads as they are custom-designed *(vis-a-vis GPUs)*, the critical point is that Google can avoid Nvidia's premium *(Nvidia has a 75% margin on its chips)* that OpenAI has to pay.\n\n\n\n* Finally, Gemini is gaining market share rapidly. Now that they have the best model and lower generation costs, they can instantly distribute it to their 4 billion-user base, thereby undercutting OpenAI’s first-mover advantage.

I see you bears posting loss porn and screaming about how the US is technically insolvent. You’re looking at the $40 Trillion debt clock and thinking \"Game Over.\" You think the only options are a hard default or hyperinflation.\n\nYou are missing the third option. The option the US government has used before to rug-pull an entire generation of savers without technically breaking a single rule.\n\nIt’s called **Financial Repression**, and it’s the macro thesis for the next decade. Here is the actual DD on how the US escapes the debt trap, based on historical facts, not doomer fanfiction.\n\n# 1. The Historical Precedent (The 1946 Playbook)\n\nYou guys think this is unprecedented? Zoom out.  \nIn 1946, after WWII, the US Debt-to-GDP ratio was **119%**. It looked exactly like it does today. By 1955, that ratio had collapsed to roughly **70%**.\n\nDid the government pay it off with budget surpluses? No.  \nDid they default? No.\n\n**They inflated it away.**  \nBetween 1946 and 1951, inflation averaged about **6-7%**, but the Fed capped Treasury bond yields at **2.5%**.  \nDo the math: If you held a bond, you were losing 4% of your purchasing power every year. The government was effectively borrowing money at negative real rates. They transferred wealth from bondholders to the Treasury. Grandpa got rug-pulled so Uncle Sam could clean up the balance sheet.\n\n# 2. The Mechanism: \"Yield Curve Control\" (YCC)\n\nPowell isn't going to raise rates to 10% to kill inflation. That would bankrupt the US government because of the interest payments.\n\nInstead, we are moving to a regime of **Yield Curve Control**.\n\n* **The Setup:** Inflation settles at a \"sticky\" 4-5% due to deglobalization and wage hikes.\n* **The Fix:** The Fed announces they will buy unlimited bonds to keep the 10-year yield at **3.5%**.\n* **The Result:** Real interest rates become negative.\n   * Inflation: 5%\n   * Yield: 3.5%\n   * **Real Rate:** \\-1.5%\n\nThis erodes the real value of the $40T debt stack by 1.5% to 2% annually. It’s a slow-motion default that nobody notices until ten years later when a Coke costs $8.\n\n# 3. The \"AI Productivity\" Kicker (The Denominator)\n\nDebt is only half the equation. It’s Debt-to-**GDP**.  \nWhile the Fed is inflating away the debt (the numerator), AI is about to pump the GDP (the denominator).\n\nWe are looking at a scenario where nominal GDP grows at 7-8% per year (4% real growth from AI efficiency + 4% inflation).  \nIf the economy grows at 8% nominal, but the debt only grows at 3% (because they raise taxes or implement a VAT), the Debt-to-GDP ratio creates a \"golden crossover\" and starts plummeting.\n\n# The Trade\n\nThe US government is going to sacrifice the Bond Market to save the Stock Market and the Dollar system.\n\n* **Short Bonds (TLT):** You are fighting the Fed and inflation. You are the designated bagholder in this scenario.\n* **Long Equities (SPY/QQQ):** In a financial repression environment, cash is trash. Money has to go somewhere. It goes into assets. Stocks act as an inflation pass-through vehicle.\n* **Long Hard Assets:** Real estate and commodities.\n\n**TL;DR:** The US isn't going broke. They are going to replay the 1946 strategy: Cap rates, let inflation run hot, and use AI growth to make the economy look bigger than the debt.\n\n**Positions:** SPY 600C Jan 2026.

Youre seeing those neon green vertical lines of SPY and GOOG and saying, pfft another dumb bear coming along to ruin the fun, and for now, you’re absolutely right. Ride the bubble while you can, but I think we can all agree that this is not sustainable by any means. Gold isn’t king because of the AI bubble shenanigans, gold is king because of the US sovereign debt. I know what you’re thinking, another boring debt doomer saying “the end is neigh”, but this isn’t just a problem for next generation, or next decade, the debt is about to be a problem literally a couple months from now. This is because of the looming US sovereign debt wall of 2026-2028, which is a mathematically guaranteed certainty. The term “debt wall” isn’t a shorthand way of saying, “gee, we sure do owe a lot of money”, this is “the interest on this debt is going to literally go vertical”. How did this happen why should I care? Here’s the gist: \n\nDuring COVID we borrowed an obscene amount of money, we all know this. We looked back on the deflationary crashes of ye olden times of 1929/2008 and said no thank you, and we chose inflation. A fair choice given the circumstances. Rates were slashed to basically nothing, and both the US treasury well as companies locked in huge huge loans of basically free money given that the interest rate was lower than inflation. Those debts were dated at 5 years, and were finally arriving at their payback date. \n\n-2026 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-2027 maturities: 7.3 trillion\n\n-2028 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-total to refinance: 25.8 TRILLION dollars \n\nNow you may be saying “how can 26/38 trillion dollars of our debt be due in The next 3 years?” The answer is because treasury secretary Janet Yellen intentionally prevented longer term bonds from being issued in 2023-2024 and flooded the market with short term T bills. This equated to 33% of all of our debt having maturity dates under 12 months. This makes our financial situation basically entirely dependant on short term changes in the interest rate. \n\nOf course, the US treasury cannot pay this money back, and thus it has to procrastinate the problem by paying it off using new debt, debt which is now at an interest rate of 4-4.5%. In 2025 our interest payments on our debt, that is, the money we pay just to stay neutral, was almost 1 trillion dollars (970 billion to be exact). This is more than the entire budget of our military, you know, the one that’s larger than the combined military spending of China, Russia, Germany, India, UK, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, France, and Japan. In 2026 alone, overnight, this refinancing will raise our interest payments on the debt by 237 billion dollars. \n\nThe congressional budget office estimated the interest payments on our debt will reach 2.6 trillion dollars by 2035, and this is assuming no new wars and no recessions at all (impossible considering the shadow debt and private equity vampires pulling a 2008 two, electric boogaloo, but let’s just ignore that for now)\n\nWhen the interest hits just 1.5 trillion, it will consume somewhere between 30-40% of our entire federal income. This is a mathematically guaranteed doomsday level of bad. The passing of the BBB has shown that we have absolutely zero interest (pun intended) in actually dealing with this problem, and the fact the government was incapable of even passing a budget and chose to shutdown for its longest period ever shows this as well. The debt is effectively unpayable, so what happens now? We have 2 choices.\n\n1. The honest path (deflationary crash). We repay our debt at the fair market rate to compensate for the incoming inflation explosion and refinance our debt at its fair value of 6-7%\n- What happens: the interest payments bankrupt the federal reserve and a failed treasury auction happens. We basically default on our debt and the financial system of the world implodes. Not going to happen. \n1. The dishonest default (inflationary melt up). The fed implements financial repression, that is, printing trillions of dollars that the market won’t buy, thus artificially lowering interest rates to 3-4% even when inflation is at 8-10%\n- What happens: the government stays solvent at the cost of burning its currency. The dollar js debased to pay our debts with worthless money.\n\nYou can kiss that duel mandate of the Fed goodby. You can’t exactly be “politically independent” when your choices are to raise rates and stop inflation and blow up the financial market of the world, or to allow for your own existence to continue and inflate away the debt. We are currently in a stagflationary market analogous to the 1970’s, with little to no broad economic growth discounting the AI hype bubble. We would be in a recession if it weren’t for AI spending. Don’t believe me? Do you believe JP Morgan and Barclays? \n- https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/markets-and-economy/top-market-takeaways/tmt-in-the-rear-view-how-did-our-2025-themes-pan-out)\n- Q1 2026 Global Outlook | Barclays Investment Bank\n\nWe have no real growth, and official inflation is 3%, far higher than our supposed goal of 2%. We all know that this number is not actually real anyways though, anyone who isn’t a billionaire and has bought anything in the few years can tell you things are getting debilitatingly expensive. Inflation numbers are a lie, and that isn’t some tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, the Bureau of Labor Statistics legitimately changed the CPI from being a “cost of goods index” to a “cost of living index”, instead measuring the cost to maintain a certain level of satisfaction. This basically means a whole bunch of shenanigans which translates to ultimately say, the official inflation numbers are not real and haven’t been for a long time. Use this nifty website to see just how ridiculous the new measuring system is: https://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts\n\nAnyways, back to the 70s, the quintessential example of stagflation. What wins when your currency is going down the drain? Well, the run-up means a whole lot of rampant buying of speculative investments, that is to say, bubbles. We’re not in an AI bubble we’re in an everything bubble. It is not normal for gold, bitcoin, and the S&P to all be at ATH, it’s not because they’re suddenly the best thing ever, it’d because cash is a guaranteed loss. And this charade likely won’t end, at least for a little while, it’s mighty hard to pop a bubble when rates are decreasing, and given the debt wall and the impossible situation the Fed is in you can bet your bottom (soon to be worthless) dollar that interest rates will keep getting cut.\n\nSo what, bubble this bubble that, why is this important? We’re all making plenty of money with those glorious green candles anyways right? Well, what goes up must come down unfortunately, and we can take a look back at the stock market of the 70s once more. There was an exact equivalent of the current Mag 7 called the Nifty Fifty, companies like Disney, IBM, Xerox, companies considered so untouchable that the price didn’t matter. Unfathomable P/E ratios of over 50, but when the degree of the inflation problem was finally understood in 1973-1974, the market crashed 50-80%. \n\nMoney fled to hard assets, land, energy, and most importantly, our old friend Gold. Gold ran up alongside everything else in the “everything bubble” phase of the early 70s, doubling from 35-70 dollars, but when the crash happened and everything else dumped Gold was standing tall at 200. However, this wasn’t the end though, things really got cooking in the late 70s when the inflationary crack up really hit and gold went up to 850 dollars per ounce. So you ask, how did we get out of it in the 70s?   In order to stop the compounding inflation and halt the free-fall loss of faith in the dollar, the Fed Chairmen Paul Volcker at the time raised rates all the way up to 20%, crushing inflation and causing a recession, which although painful, broke the inflationary spiral. It is impossible to do this now, as our debt to GDP ratio was only 30% at the time, if it were to happen now it would be choosing option 1, which isn’t possible for reasons stated prior.\n\nIt’s a lot to take in, I know. You might not believe me, and that’s ok, but just look at the smart money. Central banks are buying gold at rates not seen in decades, the holdings for gold just exceeded US Treasury reserves for the first time since 1996. Even if you still don’t believe me and think AI is going to save the world and deliver the perfect, exponential growth the financial markets demand of it, this entire multi trillion dollar narrative depends entirely on a single company on a small island right off the coast of the second most powerful country in the world, who has it baked into its very existence that its primary goal is to “unify” Taiwan back into it. The same country that has officially stated that its army must be capable of invasion by 2026, the same country whose 77 year old totalitarian leader has stated that the Taiwan problem is not generational and must be solved within his lifetime. The same country facing a demographic cliff so steep that it basically guarantees it will be unable to ever make an attempt at Taiwan unless it does so in the decade. If Taiwan is invaded or even blockaded the financial effects would be beyond comprehension. We are talking 2 or maybe 3 times as bad as 2008 overnight. You know what’s a great asset during uncertainty, volatility and war? Gold. \n\nYou probably looked at this wall of text, rolled your eyes, and scrolled to the bottom, heck maybe you even skimmed through. You don’t have to read it if you don’t want to, the TLDR summary is this: you should keep some double digit percentage of your portfolio in gold. Let me know if you think I’m wrong and why I would really love to learn. Thanks for taking the time to read what I wrote. \n\nPositions: basically entirely PHYS\n\n     PS. stay away from GLD, it’s taxed at a far far higher rate and it’s not directly tied to a physical piece of gold. PHYS isn’t a derivative investment it’s literally just a company with a giant vault of gold and you can trade your shares in directly for physical gold. No funny business, plus it’s based in Canada just in case the USA decides to ban the personal possession of Gold like in the 30s.", "score": 361, "num_comments": 143, "over_18": false, "author": "13jfncjai31"}

Rare to see a company respond this directly to one investor, which shows how much noise Burry’s comments have made.\nDo you think he has a point, or is this just another Burry vs. everyone moment?", "score": 178, "num_comments": 104, "over_18": false, "author": "Illustrious_Lie_954"}

Google’s been building out its TPU lineup since 2018, and the newer versions are optimized specifically for large-scale AI workloads. The idea is that Google can offer something more tightly integrated and potentially more efficient than off the shelf GPUs.If Meta actually goes ahead with this, it would be a pretty meaningful win for Google not just because of the business, but because it would validate Google’s long push to differentiate itself with its own silicon. For Nvidia, this doesn’t change its dominant position today, but it does show that big AI players are at least exploring alternatives instead of relying 100% on GPUs.\nIs this just Meta hedging its options, or could we actually see large AI companies start moving workloads away from Nvidia over the next few years?", "score": 119, "num_comments": 40, "over_18": false, "author": "Illustrious_Lie_954"}

Michael Saylor (Strategy CEO) also \"promises\" to never sell Bitcoin. This means that dividends can only be paid by raising more money from new investors. If this was secret it would be called a ponzi scheme, maybe the fact that it's clearly written down in the 8-K filings to the SEC makes this totally fine 🤡\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz9nc2wf5e3g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=623ccfd846819b6e8ea7c90ad49baf0874717e9b\n\nThe reception to the post was overwhelmingly positive; also most people called it obvious, \"everyone knows this, timing is the issue!\" [Maybe everyone except this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p3i7c4/its_over_for_me/), but yeah. I'm a bit sorry for the guy, but hey he is looking for a regular job now, welcome to the world of people with regular jobs.\n\nIn contrast, the media seemed to be quiet back then; until basically now, now that the MSTR price does look grim. Now also indices are considering to ban Strategy and the like, but it feels a little bit like the Michael Burry moment where the banks are finally valuating the credit swaps in his favor...\n\nThe comments in that post were a Big Short meme fest, emphasizing the difficulty of the correct timing, not just the correct call in general. This is part of the inspiration for the calculation that I will show you now. It won't solve this issue, but it will give it some refinement.\n\n# The Strategy/MSTR Ponzi-Ratio Curve\n\nThe question that I am asking here is: How much of the money raised is spent on BTC and how much is spent (or promised) on preferred stock dividends (the instruments used to raise the money)? Put this in a fraction and plot its trajectory over time, I present to you: the ponzi ratio curve! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bx6118tv9e3g1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f97e2009e4f71f9f2dcd63472169f5705237410f\n\nTo do this I have normalized everything to daily values. The actual dividend payments are quarterly, the BTC acquisitions and preferred stock issuances are mostly weekly. Currently Strategy promises dividends of \\~700M$ yearly, so every day almost 2M$. (Note that at the time of my first post only STRK existed. Now there are five different versions of preferred stock that are used to cross finance each other, etc. I'd say it's a mechanism to find out how to cause the maximum confusion.) So the blue curves track the issuance volume of those preferred shares but they just show the resulting promised dividends.\n\nNote: Some money is also raised through diluting MSTR main shares. This is pictured here only as part of the BTC acquisitions. MSTR/A does not pay dividends so its not part of the blue curves.\n\n# Okay but what does that mean?\n\nMore money for past investors, less for BTC. But you have to know, the promised fixed dividends, they are just that, promised. They look like a fixed coupon but they can simply decide not to pay them.\n\nMy hypothesis for an end game scenario is: Once Strategy decides they do not pay dividends, their ability to raise any new money will end abpruptly. Without the ability to buy new BTC, their \"business model\" is dead. MSTR is not celebrated for having bitcoin, it is celebrated for buying bitcoin and pumping the price. The moment they just sit on this pile of bitcoin that doesn't generate any dividends while their fund raising stalls is the moment where people will realize that you need to also be able to sell an asset that you borrow against. If Kim Jong-un stole the Mona Lisa and hung it over his bed in Pyongyang, Morgan Stanley woud flip him the bird if he wanted to borrow some money against it. Because he can't sell it (to anyone with actual money), even though he might be the legal owner under North Korean law. Saylor did not steal the bitcoin, but he promised to never sell it. He said nothing is more worth than bitcoin, you never sell your bitcoin, yada, yada. So just by keeping his promise he can't sell; but even if he breaks it: What do you think will happen to the bitcoin price if its biggest advocate (and holder of 3%) decides that: \"Now actually yeah, now is a good moment to sell your bictoin\".\n\nSo I am seeing a mexican standoff between Strategy and BTC. Strategy will simply try to wait it out, but the risk is that people sell their bitcoin before Strategy is forced to. Because Strategy has actual debt and can actually go bancrupt. We're probably speaking of 10k$-ish BTC, you have to decide how likely that is and how aware the crypto community will be of the trojan ponzi time bomb that Strategy gifted them.\n\n# Technical Stuff an Disclaimer\n\nI partly vibe coded this. I used ChatGPT-API to read out 8-K filings to get the preferred stock issuance timeline. Some numbers don't agree exactly with their dashbord on the website, but it's close enough that it shouldn't disturb the picture. But please double check everything yourself, here is the code that I used:\n\n[Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZH6ZnhrOf-QJ3T7s1Pxax1uc97fWazEU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# My Position\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmqfx7l2le3g1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebaf560113140127b86364364ac57cb7a316149e", "score": 97, "num_comments": 77, "over_18": false, "author": "JulianHabekost"}

Currently, the tech giant leases its TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to AI developers through Google Cloud. This means these chips are confined to Google's own data centers and are not sold externally, contrary to reports by The Information.\n\nThe report also indicates Google is now marketing TPUs to its other cloud customers, with the company claiming this move could potentially capture up to 10% of Nvidia's annual revenue. Following this news, shares of Nvidia's competitor AMD (AMD) fell by more than 8%.\n\nThis move reflects a growing trend where Nvidia's largest customers are becoming some of its biggest competitive threats.\n\nBeyond Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have also developed their own AI chips. Amazon recently completed a major data center project, leasing its custom-built 500,000 AI chips to Anthropic, one of the leading AI developers. Google recently announced a major partnership with Anthropic (ANTH.PVT), while OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) reportedly tested the company's AI chips this summer.\n\nIn recent months, speculation has grown that Google is expanding its artificial intelligence chip business to compete more directly with Nvidia.\n\nIn a September report, investment firm DA Davidson noted that “several prominent cutting-edge AI labs” have shown “strong interest” in acquiring Google's TPUs. The firm estimates Google's TPU business and its AI division DeepMind could be worth as much as $90 billion.\n\nNVIDIA's stock declined on the latest news, erasing earlier gains in tech shares on Monday as the sector began rebounding from a steep decline. Both NVIDIA and other major tech stocks have faced pressure in recent months amid growing concerns about an AI bubble.\n\nNVIDIA has faced criticism for its circular AI transactions the leading AI chipmaker invests in its own customers while famed “big short” investor Michael Burry recently bet on the company's decline, claiming the AI market resembles the dot com bubble.\n\nHowever, the company sought to dispel some of these concerns in a memo sent to Wall Street analysts over the weekend.\n\n“NVIDIA is fully transparent about its strategic investments... Companies in NVIDIA's strategic portfolio are rapidly growing their own revenues, indicating they are on a path to profitability and demonstrating strong underlying customer demand for AI applications,” the company stated in a memo obtained by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also specifically rebutted critics who have drawn parallels to past accounting scandals, writing: “NVIDIA bears no resemblance to historical accounting frauds because our underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is fully transparent, and we place a premium on our reputation for integrity.”\n\nNVIDIA elaborated on why it believes itself fundamentally different from companies like Enron, WorldCom, or Lucent.", "score": 40, "num_comments": 20, "over_18": false, "author": "Aluseda"}

Given that I paid 106, I'll get 13 pounds. This is approximately 4.3% per year.\nBut I think that I need to consider also the taxes on the last year.\nIf I am not mistaken, I would pay less taxes last year because I will be able to detract the lost 6 pounds. That's around 3 pounds of taxes on the last year. So it's like 1 pound a year: 14 in total that corresponds to 4.6%.\nIf I switch to this gilts, I will take more risks because the interest rate can go up.
