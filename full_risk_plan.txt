Section 1 Final Verdict

SELL

Section 2 Risk Rationale

The Safe analyst presented the most convincing argument. While the Risky analyst focused on potential upside, the potential for a trade ban poses a significant and immediate threat to Apple's supply chain and profitability. The Neutral analyst's compromise was reasonable, but the trader's plan to exit swiftly is the more prudent approach given the uncertainty. Preserving capital is paramount in this scenario.
