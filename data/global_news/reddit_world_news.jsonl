I'm just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for 'guaranteed 10x' and I still see Cramer fanboys... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up... the true challenge is who can predict success over time.

I still have high conviction in the GOOGL/QQQ trade.

Do not manage your portfolio daily, manage it monthly at most. **Every time you buy OR sell an option you are losing money to the market makers.** Everybody on here will give advice to \"lock in gains\" or \"roll to a new position\" if you're up, when in reality you're bleeding money to hedge fund algorithms every time you make any trade at all. Trading options at all is inherently a losing game, but if you want to minimize the money you pay to market makers, simply make fewer trades. If you start with 1k and put it into options: imagine paying like 3-10% of that to market makers every time you reinvest it (on average) — so if you reinvest the same money 5 times, you are essentially 'paying' 15-40% of your expected value to algorithms/market makers. I sometimes think that the hedge funds themselves are in this sub astroturfing to get people to trade daily because it's so profitable for them.\n2. Human emotion is your greatest weakness. There are algorithms that are literally designed to manipulate retail traders into panic buying or selling. **If you ever want to make a trade, WAIT 24H** and if you still want to do it the next day, go for it. Retail traders never have knowledge before the big funds, so there is NEVER a rush to make a trade. Rushing will only hurt you.", "score": 4427, "num_comments": 286, "over_18": false, "author": "trentcoolyak"}

Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon.

Google used its own processors *(TPUs)* and not Nvidia chips to train the Gemini 3 model. This means Google has just leapfrogged OpenAI in the competition, and the structural advantages are now becoming evident.\n\n* Google has 4 billion users across Search, YouTube, and Gmail who generate valuable training data for their models. Compared to this, all the data OpenAI uses must either be scraped from the web *(which raises copyright issues)* or acquired from other companies *(which worsens their margins)*.\n\n\n\n* The TPUs that Google used for training their latest model are designed by Google itself and integrated directly into Google’s data centers. While there are rumors that TPUs are better for machine learning workloads as they are custom-designed *(vis-a-vis GPUs)*, the critical point is that Google can avoid Nvidia's premium *(Nvidia has a 75% margin on its chips)* that OpenAI has to pay.\n\n\n\n* Finally, Gemini is gaining market share rapidly. Now that they have the best model and lower generation costs, they can instantly distribute it to their 4 billion-user base, thereby undercutting OpenAI’s first-mover advantage.

Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza.\n\n>As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade.\n\n>Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012.\n\n>The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024.\n\n>Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\n>Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.)\n\n>“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.”\n\n>Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said.\n\n>The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior.\n\n>Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year.\n\n>A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.”\n\n>Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found.\n\n>Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide?\n\n>The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending.\n\n>Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring.\n\n>“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.", "score": 1504, "num_comments": 268, "over_18": false, "author": "callsonreddit"}

That is roughly 14x their current subscriber count.\n\nI have been crunching the numbers and looking at the competitive landscape since the Gemini 3.0 / Claude Opus 4.5 releases, and honestly? The math is broken.\n\nThere is a massive bias in this sub and on Reddit in general. We are the power users. We are the ones digging into specific use cases or coding workflows. But we are a tiny bubble. The vast majority of OpenAI’s 800M+ weekly active users are free-tier casuals who use it to write a birthday email or summarize a PDF. They have zero loyalty because \"good enough\" is all they need.\n\nHere is my analysis why the fundamentals won't support the valuation:\n\n1. The \"Amazon\" comparison is lazy\nPeople keep saying \"Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years\" to justify OpenAI burning billions. It is a bad comparison. Amazon spent money building warehouses, logistics networks, and eventually their own data centers. They were building assets they owned. The spend was on Capex.\nOpenAI is spending billions on Opex. They are renting compute from Microsoft and Oracle. Look at the numbers: they have a $300 Billion commitment to Oracle and over $22 Billion committed to CoreWeave. They do not own the infrastructure. They are renting the penthouse. If Amazon stopped spending, they still had a massive delivery network. If OpenAI stops spending, the server lights go out immediately.\n\n2. Startup 101: Validate, Dominate, then Expand\nNormally, to become a platform, you dominate one vertical first. Amazon dominated books. Google dominated search. Once you have the cash flow and the users, you expand.\nOpenAI is trying to skip the \"dominate\" phase. They are throwing spaghetti at the wall. Search, Voice, Canvas, Sora, Shopping. They are trying to disrupt markets without validating the demand first. Meanwhile, they are losing the one vertical they actually had. Recent data suggests Anthropic has already flipped the enterprise API market, taking a 30%+ share while OpenAI slides down to 25% because developers prefer Claude for coding.\n\n3. The Google Trap\nMost users are on the free plan. What happens if OpenAI forces them to pay? They leave. What happens if they flood the chat with ads to monetize the free users? They leave.\nGoogle knows this. They are likely just waiting for OpenAI to break the user experience to capture the churn. The \"Gemini for Students\" move was genius because it gets users hooked on the ecosystem (Docs/Drive) for free. (600 Mio Gemini users! App, not including search! Probably highly overlapping with OpenAI's userbase). When OpenAI puts up a wall, Google will be there with open arms to capture the 98% of users who won't pay $20/month.\n\n4. The AGI Hype vs. Reality\nWe need to be real about the tech. Transformers are just huge attention networks creating probabilistic links between words. They are non-deterministic. They do not \"think\" or understand physics.\nYou cannot build a safe AGI on a system that is fundamentally a randomizer. This is why the experts are leaving. Ilya Sutskever left to start SSI. John Schulman left. Yann LeCunn left Meta. In late 2025 alone, over 20 top researchers left OpenAI and Google to work on \"World Models\" because they know Transformers have hit a ceiling.\nAlso, do not fall for the CEO marketing trap. When Sam Altman says \"I am afraid this tech will destroy us,\" that is just hype generation. Danger implies capability. It is the best way to mask the fact that the models are plateauing.\n\n5. The Financials are a Horror Show\nLet’s look at the actual 2025 numbers that have leaked.\nFor the first half of 2025, they generated about $4.3 Billion in revenue. Sounds good? Not when you see the burn.\nReports suggest they lost nearly $13.5 Billion in the same period.\nEven worse, Microsoft’s earnings leaks implied OpenAI lost another $12 Billion just in Q3 2025.\nThey are burning cash faster than they can print it. The \"circular financing\" loop (Nvidia invests -> OpenAI buys chips -> Nvidia books revenue) is the only thing propping up the narrative. When you are losing $3 for every $1 you make, you are not a platform. You are a subsidy machine for Microsoft's cloud division.\n\nAnd if the circular revenue doesn't scare you, look at the employee compensation timebomb. OpenAI doesn't give normal stock; they give PPUs (Profit Participation Units). Because of their capped-profit structure, these aren't ownership stakes, but moreover promises of future profit distributions. As the valuation skyrockets to ~$500B, the accounting value of these \"promises\" explodes. On a balance sheet, this scales like a massive liability. If they ever want to IPO or convert to a standard Public Benefit Corporation (which they are desperately trying to do right now/are in proceeds to do), they have to convert these PPUs. That conversion would trigger a compensation expense so large it would likely wipe out their \"paper\" profits for the next decade. They are effectively borrowing against their own hype to pay their staff.\n\n6. Zero Moat\nPeople argue that \"Chat History\" is a moat. It isn't. I exported my ChatGPT history to JSON and imported it into a local client in 5 minutes. Switching from ChatGPT to Gemini 3.0 took me 30 seconds.\n\nConclusion\nI have to end with a question. The people running OpenAI are YC alums and some of the smartest minds in tech. They know how startups work. They know you need to validate problems and dominate verticals. Yet everything they are doing screams the exact opposite.\nAre they just bad at productizing, where overhelmed by the hype of LLMs themself and strategically not prepared or is there some 4D chess strategy here that I am completely missing? Because from where I am standing, they look less like Google and more like Uber in 2015.", "score": 1117, "num_comments": 282, "over_18": false, "author": "RasenMeow"}

Youre seeing those neon green vertical lines of SPY and GOOG and saying, pfft another dumb bear coming along to ruin the fun, and for now, you’re absolutely right. Ride the bubble while you can, but I think we can all agree that this is not sustainable by any means. Gold isn’t king because of the AI bubble shenanigans, gold is king because of the US sovereign debt. I know what you’re thinking, another boring debt doomer saying “the end is neigh”, but this isn’t just a problem for next generation, or next decade, the debt is about to be a problem literally a couple months from now. This is because of the looming US sovereign debt wall of 2026-2028, which is a mathematically guaranteed certainty. The term “debt wall” isn’t a shorthand way of saying, “gee, we sure do owe a lot of money”, this is “the interest on this debt is going to literally go vertical”. How did this happen why should I care? Here’s the gist: \n\nDuring COVID we borrowed an obscene amount of money, we all know this. We looked back on the deflationary crashes of ye olden times of 1929/2008 and said no thank you, and we chose inflation. A fair choice given the circumstances. Rates were slashed to basically nothing, and both the US treasury well as companies locked in huge huge loans of basically free money given that the interest rate was lower than inflation. Those debts were dated at 5 years, and were finally arriving at their payback date. \n\n-2026 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-2027 maturities: 7.3 trillion\n\n-2028 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-total to refinance: 25.8 TRILLION dollars \n\nNow you may be saying “how can 26/38 trillion dollars of our debt be due in The next 3 years?” The answer is because treasury secretary Janet Yellen intentionally prevented longer term bonds from being issued in 2023-2024 and flooded the market with short term T bills. This equated to 33% of all of our debt having maturity dates under 12 months. This makes our financial situation basically entirely dependant on short term changes in the interest rate. \n\nOf course, the US treasury cannot pay this money back, and thus it has to procrastinate the problem by paying it off using new debt, debt which is now at an interest rate of 4-4.5%. In 2025 our interest payments on our debt, that is, the money we pay just to stay neutral, was almost 1 trillion dollars (970 billion to be exact). This is more than the entire budget of our military, you know, the one that’s larger than the combined military spending of China, Russia, Germany, India, UK, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, France, and Japan. In 2026 alone, overnight, this refinancing will raise our interest payments on the debt by 237 billion dollars. \n\nThe congressional budget office estimated the interest payments on our debt will reach 2.6 trillion dollars by 2035, and this is assuming no new wars and no recessions at all (impossible considering the shadow debt and private equity vampires pulling a 2008 two, electric boogaloo, but let’s just ignore that for now)\n\nWhen the interest hits just 1.5 trillion, it will consume somewhere between 30-40% of our entire federal income. This is a mathematically guaranteed doomsday level of bad. The passing of the BBB has shown that we have absolutely zero interest (pun intended) in actually dealing with this problem, and the fact the government was incapable of even passing a budget and chose to shutdown for its longest period ever shows this as well. The debt is effectively unpayable, so what happens now? We have 2 choices.\n\n1. The honest path (deflationary crash). We repay our debt at the fair market rate to compensate for the incoming inflation explosion and refinance our debt at its fair value of 6-7%\n- What happens: the interest payments bankrupt the federal reserve and a failed treasury auction happens. We basically default on our debt and the financial system of the world implodes. Not going to happen. \n1. The dishonest default (inflationary melt up). The fed implements financial repression, that is, printing trillions of dollars that the market won’t buy, thus artificially lowering interest rates to 3-4% even when inflation is at 8-10%\n- What happens: the government stays solvent at the cost of burning its currency. The dollar js debased to pay our debts with worthless money.\n\nYou can kiss that duel mandate of the Fed goodby. You can’t exactly be “politically independent” when your choices are to raise rates and stop inflation and blow up the financial market of the world, or to allow for your own existence to continue and inflate away the debt. We are currently in a stagflationary market analogous to the 1970’s, with little to no broad economic growth discounting the AI hype bubble. We would be in a recession if it weren’t for AI spending. Don’t believe me? Do you believe JP Morgan and Barclays? \n- https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/markets-and-economy/top-market-takeaways/tmt-in-the-rear-view-how-did-our-2025-themes-pan-out)\n- Q1 2026 Global Outlook | Barclays Investment Bank\n\nWe have no real growth, and official inflation is 3%, far higher than our supposed goal of 2%. We all know that this number is not actually real anyways though, anyone who isn’t a billionaire and has bought anything in the few years can tell you things are getting debilitatingly expensive. Inflation numbers are a lie, and that isn’t some tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, the Bureau of Labor Statistics legitimately changed the CPI from being a “cost of goods index” to a “cost of living index”, instead measuring the cost to maintain a certain level of satisfaction. This basically means a whole bunch of shenanigans which translates to ultimately say, the official inflation numbers are not real and haven’t been for a long time. Use this nifty website to see just how ridiculous the new measuring system is: https://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts\n\nAnyways, back to the 70s, the quintessential example of stagflation. What wins when your currency is going down the drain? Well, the run-up means a whole lot of rampant buying of speculative investments, that is to say, bubbles. We’re not in an AI bubble we’re in an everything bubble. It is not normal for gold, bitcoin, and the S&P to all be at ATH, it’s not because they’re suddenly the best thing ever, it’d because cash is a guaranteed loss. And this charade likely won’t end, at least for a little while, it’s mighty hard to pop a bubble when rates are decreasing, and given the debt wall and the impossible situation the Fed is in you can bet your bottom (soon to be worthless) dollar that interest rates will keep getting cut.\n\nSo what, bubble this bubble that, why is this important? We’re all making plenty of money with those glorious green candles anyways right? Well, what goes up must come down unfortunately, and we can take a look back at the stock market of the 70s once more. There was an exact equivalent of the current Mag 7 called the Nifty Fifty, companies like Disney, IBM, Xerox, companies considered so untouchable that the price didn’t matter. Unfathomable P/E ratios of over 50, but when the degree of the inflation problem was finally understood in 1973-1974, the market crashed 50-80%. \n\nMoney fled to hard assets, land, energy, and most importantly, our old friend Gold. Gold ran up alongside everything else in the “everything bubble” phase of the early 70s, doubling from 35-70 dollars, but when the crash happened and everything else dumped Gold was standing tall at 200. However, this wasn’t the end though, things really got cooking in the late 70s when the inflationary crack up really hit and gold went up to 850 dollars per ounce. So you ask, how did we get out of it in the 70s?   In order to stop the compounding inflation and halt the free-fall loss of faith in the dollar, the Fed Chairmen Paul Volcker at the time raised rates all the way up to 20%, crushing inflation and causing a recession, which although painful, broke the inflationary spiral. It is impossible to do this now, as our debt to GDP ratio was only 30% at the time, if it were to happen now it would be choosing option 1, which isn’t possible for reasons stated prior.\n\nIt’s a lot to take in, I know. You might not believe me, and that’s ok, but just look at the smart money. Central banks are buying gold at rates not seen in decades, the holdings for gold just exceeded US Treasury reserves for the first time since 1996. Even if you still don’t believe me and think AI is going to save the world and deliver the perfect, exponential growth the financial markets demand of it, this entire multi trillion dollar narrative depends entirely on a single company on a small island right off the coast of the second most powerful country in the world, who has it baked into its very existence that its primary goal is to “unify” Taiwan back into it. The same country that has officially stated that its army must be capable of invasion by 2026, the same country whose 77 year old totalitarian leader has stated that the Taiwan problem is not generational and must be solved within his lifetime. The same country facing a demographic cliff so steep that it basically guarantees it will be unable to ever make an attempt at Taiwan unless it does so in the decade. If Taiwan is invaded or even blockaded the financial effects would be beyond comprehension. We are talking 2 or maybe 3 times as bad as 2008 overnight. You know what’s a great asset during uncertainty, volatility and war? Gold. \n\nYou probably looked at this wall of text, rolled your eyes, and scrolled to the bottom, heck maybe you even skimmed through. You don’t have to read it if you don’t want to, the TLDR summary is this: you should keep some double digit percentage of your portfolio in gold. Let me know if you think I’m wrong and why I would really love to learn. Thanks for taking the time to read what I wrote. \n\nPositions: basically entirely PHYS\n\n     PS. stay away from GLD, it’s taxed at a far far higher rate and it’s not directly tied to a physical piece of gold.

Consumers surveyed by Deloitte said that they planned to spend $622 on average over that period, down 4 per cent year on year.\n>\n>Black Friday kicks off the frenzied final weeks of the winter holiday shopping season, driving sales that can make or break retailers’ annual profits.\n>\n>This year’s sales come as affordability concerns rise up the US political agenda in the face of stubborn inflation and an uptick in unemployment. Shoppers who planned to tighten their belts cited the higher cost of living and financial constraints, Deloitte said. \n>\n>Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer at Target, said: “As we approach the holidays, we know consumers remain cautious. Sentiment is at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability and tariffs.”\n>\n>“Yet they remain emotionally motivated. They want to celebrate with loved ones without overspending,” he told analysts last week. \n>\n>US retailers now begin Black Friday promotions weeks earlier than the Friday following Thanksgiving as they blend online and digital commerce.\n>\n>Retail giant Walmart is running three sets of deals this month, the third concluding on Monday. Target’s Black Friday event covers the entire week, offering deals such as half price for some Beats headphones, Instant Pot cookware and Barbie dolls. \n>\n>Executives and analysts have acknowledged the strain on some customers in 2025. “What we are seeing is just a lot of uncertainty in the market and people really feeling higher prices,” said Lupine Skelly, retail research leader at Deloitte.\n>\n>At Kohl’s, the US department store chain, “discretionary income remains pressured. This is especially notable in our low to middle-income consumers, as well as in our younger customers,” Michael Bender, its new chief executive, told analysts this week. “The holidays are always a promotional time period, and we expect this to continue this year, especially given the state of the consumer.”  \n>\n>Annual growth in sales is expected to slow slightly during the holiday season spanning November and December, the NRF forecast, to between 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in 2024. Total sales are likely to top $1tn for the first time.\n>\n>Retailers and brands have kicked off promotions well before Thanksgiving. So far this month, online sales have increased by 7.5 per cent year over year to nearly $80bn, according to Adobe Analytics. Comparable data on sales at physical stores is not yet available.\n>\n>Retailers have reported some price rises in order to offset higher costs of imports following the tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on US trading partners this year.\n>\n>Eighty-five per cent of consumers surveyed by the NRF said they expect higher prices for gifts and holiday items because of tariffs. \n>\n>US consumer confidence has dropped to the lowest level since Trump launched the global trade war in April, the Conference Board reported this week, clouding the outlook for future sales.\n>\n>\n>Much of the expected rise in total spending “reflects higher prices, not higher confidence”, according to consultancy Accenture’s holiday shopping survey.\n>\n>Gift cards will be the top Christmas present this year, followed by apparel and toys or games, a consumer survey by market research firm Numerator showed.\n>\n>Skelly at Deloitte said the preference for gift cards likely showed consumers responding to affordability worries. “When people start experiencing higher prices and talking a lot about it, they tend to go to gift cards,” she said. “What happens is, ‘Hey, I’ll buy you the $50 gift card, and you can go buy the $57 sweater.’ It kind of puts the pressure back on the gift recipient.”", "score": 636, "num_comments": 93, "over_18": false, "author": "Prudent-Corgi3793"}

They're specialized chips that can only do AI math, but that makes them incredibly fast and energy efficient.\n\nThe performance improvements over the previous version were huge. And it shows AI still has plenty of room to grow as long as the chips and algorithms keep getting better.\n\nSo yeah, we might be in a '98 situation.

Google’s been building out its TPU lineup since 2018, and the newer versions are optimized specifically for large-scale AI workloads. The idea is that Google can offer something more tightly integrated and potentially more efficient than off the shelf GPUs.If Meta actually goes ahead with this, it would be a pretty meaningful win for Google not just because of the business, but because it would validate Google’s long push to differentiate itself with its own silicon. For Nvidia, this doesn’t change its dominant position today, but it does show that big AI players are at least exploring alternatives instead of relying 100% on GPUs.\nIs this just Meta hedging its options, or could we actually see large AI companies start moving workloads away from Nvidia over the next few years?", "score": 300, "num_comments": 56, "over_18": false, "author": "Illustrious_Lie_954"}

Currently, the tech giant leases its TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to AI developers through Google Cloud. This means these chips are confined to Google's own data centers and are not sold externally, contrary to reports by The Information.\n\nThe report also indicates Google is now marketing TPUs to its other cloud customers, with the company claiming this move could potentially capture up to 10% of Nvidia's annual revenue. Following this news, shares of Nvidia's competitor AMD (AMD) fell by more than 8%.\n\nThis move reflects a growing trend where Nvidia's largest customers are becoming some of its biggest competitive threats.\n\nBeyond Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have also developed their own AI chips. Amazon recently completed a major data center project, leasing its custom-built 500,000 AI chips to Anthropic, one of the leading AI developers. Google recently announced a major partnership with Anthropic (ANTH.PVT), while OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) reportedly tested the company's AI chips this summer.\n\nIn recent months, speculation has grown that Google is expanding its artificial intelligence chip business to compete more directly with Nvidia.\n\nIn a September report, investment firm DA Davidson noted that “several prominent cutting-edge AI labs” have shown “strong interest” in acquiring Google's TPUs. The firm estimates Google's TPU business and its AI division DeepMind could be worth as much as $90 billion.\n\nNVIDIA's stock declined on the latest news, erasing earlier gains in tech shares on Monday as the sector began rebounding from a steep decline. Both NVIDIA and other major tech stocks have faced pressure in recent months amid growing concerns about an AI bubble.\n\nNVIDIA has faced criticism for its circular AI transactions the leading AI chipmaker invests in its own customers while famed “big short” investor Michael Burry recently bet on the company's decline, claiming the AI market resembles the dot com bubble.\n\nHowever, the company sought to dispel some of these concerns in a memo sent to Wall Street analysts over the weekend.\n\n“NVIDIA is fully transparent about its strategic investments... Companies in NVIDIA's strategic portfolio are rapidly growing their own revenues, indicating they are on a path to profitability and demonstrating strong underlying customer demand for AI applications,” the company stated in a memo obtained by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also specifically rebutted critics who have drawn parallels to past accounting scandals, writing: “NVIDIA bears no resemblance to historical accounting frauds because our underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is fully transparent, and we place a premium on our reputation for integrity.”\n\nNVIDIA elaborated on why it believes itself fundamentally different from companies like Enron, WorldCom, or Lucent.", "score": 105, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "author": "Aluseda"}

She has given us some good advice and been helpful, considering we knew absolutely nothing about investing when we started our account with her.  She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money, but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETF's that \"her team\" has chosen based on our risk assessment.  I periodically receive buy & sell orders, which is nice to see that the account *is* in-fact being actively managed to a degree, but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the S&P 500, so they're really not beating the market.\n\nWe pay her 1% of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an \"advisors fee\" and currently have roughly $450k in the account.  When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole, but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by - CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started.  I recently (fairly bluntly) asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1% advisors fee we pay if they're not beating the market.  She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was \"the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds, retirement goals, tax deference strategies, etc.\".  Okay, all makes sense and is respected, but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my son's 529 and she told me \"we don't do that\".  What she meant was they don't have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity, and therefore couldn't make their 1% on it.  That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives, fees, etc.  But I ended up having to do all the research myself, which I realized wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would have been.  Still though, would have been nice if the $4,500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself...\n\nI'm starting to feel - especially from reading others' sentiments on this subreddit - that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected, and/or for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves - i.e. have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25% and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear.\n\nMy wife and I are both very young and, barring nothing unexpected, should not need this money for quite a long time.  As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not touch it for another 25+ years.  Over that much time, that 1% fee we're paying adds up to a good chunk of money, esp. when factoring in compounding interest.  I'm not trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible, esp. if there is good reason to be paying it.  But it's certainly not nothing, and I wouldn't mind it if I felt like we were actually *getting* something for paying it.\n\nIs this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1% back into our pocket and just do something like VT & chill?  Or do I just stay the course, let her and her team continue \"managing\" everything, and when if/when we need the help I have someone readily available to me?", "score": 92, "num_comments": 220, "over_18": false, "author": "markprice211"}

Whether you approach this sector through EV batteries, grid infrastructure, backup power or commercial storage, the trend is firmly up.\n\nOn the big end of the spectrum, Panasonic continues to be a global force with more than $5B in battery-related revenue last fiscal year, supplying everything from EVs to grid storage. BYD remains the world’s top EV manufacturer and one of the largest battery producers, integrating most of its supply chain internally. Albemarle stays central to battery metals, delivering lithium products from mines on several continents. And for investors wanting something steadier, NextEra Energy is one of the largest wind and solar operators in the world, heavily dependent on storage to balance its generation portfolio. Bloom Energy brings solid oxide fuel cell systems to hospitals and commercial facilities, while Enphase remains a major player in rooftop solar and home energy storage. ABB still stands as the backbone provider for modern electrification and industrial power systems.\n\nIn the higher beta small-cap bucket, several names sit much closer to the edge of the grid transition.
