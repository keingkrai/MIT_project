Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders.\n\nBurry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market.\n\nHe noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution.\n\nBurry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations.

Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza.\n\n>As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade.\n\n>Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012.\n\n>The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024.\n\n>Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\n>Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.)\n\n>“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.”\n\n>Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said.\n\n>The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior.\n\n>Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year.\n\n>A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.”\n\n>Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found.\n\n>Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide?\n\n>The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending.\n\n>Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring.\n\n>“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.", "score": 1881, "num_comments": 309, "over_18": false, "author": "callsonreddit"}

Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in.\n\nIn the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said.\n\nThere will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development.\n\nThe newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt", "score": 1326, "num_comments": 305, "over_18": false, "author": "Old-Competition3596"}

That is roughly 14x their current subscriber count.\n\nI have been crunching the numbers and looking at the competitive landscape since the Gemini 3.0 / Claude Opus 4.5 releases, and honestly? The math is broken.\n\nThere is a massive bias in this sub and on Reddit in general. We are the power users. We are the ones digging into specific use cases or coding workflows. But we are a tiny bubble. The vast majority of OpenAI’s 800M+ weekly active users are free-tier casuals who use it to write a birthday email or summarize a PDF. They have zero loyalty because \"good enough\" is all they need.\n\nHere is my analysis why the fundamentals won't support the valuation:\n\n1. The \"Amazon\" comparison is lazy\nPeople keep saying \"Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years\" to justify OpenAI burning billions. It is a bad comparison. Amazon spent money building warehouses, logistics networks, and eventually their own data centers. They were building assets they owned. The spend was on Capex.\nOpenAI is spending billions on Opex. They are renting compute from Microsoft and Oracle. Look at the numbers: they have a $300 Billion commitment to Oracle and over $22 Billion committed to CoreWeave. They do not own the infrastructure. They are renting the penthouse. If Amazon stopped spending, they still had a massive delivery network. If OpenAI stops spending, the server lights go out immediately.\n\n2. Startup 101: Validate, Dominate, then Expand\nNormally, to become a platform, you dominate one vertical first. Amazon dominated books. Google dominated search. Once you have the cash flow and the users, you expand.\nOpenAI is trying to skip the \"dominate\" phase. They are throwing spaghetti at the wall. Search, Voice, Canvas, Sora, Shopping. They are trying to disrupt markets without validating the demand first. Meanwhile, they are losing the one vertical they actually had. Recent data suggests Anthropic has already flipped the enterprise API market, taking a 30%+ share while OpenAI slides down to 25% because developers prefer Claude for coding.\n\n3. The Google Trap\nMost users are on the free plan. What happens if OpenAI forces them to pay? They leave. What happens if they flood the chat with ads to monetize the free users? They leave.\nGoogle knows this. They are likely just waiting for OpenAI to break the user experience to capture the churn. The \"Gemini for Students\" move was genius because it gets users hooked on the ecosystem (Docs/Drive) for free. (600 Mio Gemini users! App, not including search! Probably highly overlapping with OpenAI's userbase). When OpenAI puts up a wall, Google will be there with open arms to capture the 98% of users who won't pay $20/month.\n\n4. The AGI Hype vs. Reality\nWe need to be real about the tech. Transformers are just huge attention networks creating probabilistic links between words. They are non-deterministic. They do not \"think\" or understand physics.\nYou cannot build a safe AGI on a system that is fundamentally a randomizer. This is why the experts are leaving. Ilya Sutskever left to start SSI. John Schulman left. Yann LeCunn left Meta. In late 2025 alone, over 20 top researchers left OpenAI and Google to work on \"World Models\" because they know Transformers have hit a ceiling.\nAlso, do not fall for the CEO marketing trap. When Sam Altman says \"I am afraid this tech will destroy us,\" that is just hype generation. Danger implies capability. It is the best way to mask the fact that the models are plateauing.\n\n5. The Financials are a Horror Show\nLet’s look at the actual 2025 numbers that have leaked.\nFor the first half of 2025, they generated about $4.3 Billion in revenue. Sounds good? Not when you see the burn.\nReports suggest they lost nearly $13.5 Billion in the same period.\nEven worse, Microsoft’s earnings leaks implied OpenAI lost another $12 Billion just in Q3 2025.\nThey are burning cash faster than they can print it. The \"circular financing\" loop (Nvidia invests -> OpenAI buys chips -> Nvidia books revenue) is the only thing propping up the narrative. When you are losing $3 for every $1 you make, you are not a platform. You are a subsidy machine for Microsoft's cloud division.\n\nAnd if the circular revenue doesn't scare you, look at the employee compensation timebomb. OpenAI doesn't give normal stock; they give PPUs (Profit Participation Units). Because of their capped-profit structure, these aren't ownership stakes, but moreover promises of future profit distributions. As the valuation skyrockets to ~$500B, the accounting value of these \"promises\" explodes. On a balance sheet, this scales like a massive liability. If they ever want to IPO or convert to a standard Public Benefit Corporation (which they are desperately trying to do right now/are in proceeds to do), they have to convert these PPUs. That conversion would trigger a compensation expense so large it would likely wipe out their \"paper\" profits for the next decade. They are effectively borrowing against their own hype to pay their staff.\n\n6. Zero Moat\nPeople argue that \"Chat History\" is a moat. It isn't. I exported my ChatGPT history to JSON and imported it into a local client in 5 minutes. Switching from ChatGPT to Gemini 3.0 took me 30 seconds.\n\nConclusion\nI have to end with a question. The people running OpenAI are YC alums and some of the smartest minds in tech. They know how startups work. They know you need to validate problems and dominate verticals. Yet everything they are doing screams the exact opposite.\nAre they just bad at productizing, where overhelmed by the hype of LLMs themself and strategically not prepared or is there some 4D chess strategy here that I am completely missing? Because from where I am standing, they look less like Google and more like Uber in 2015.", "score": 1144, "num_comments": 286, "over_18": false, "author": "RasenMeow"}

Consumers surveyed by Deloitte said that they planned to spend $622 on average over that period, down 4 per cent year on year.\n>\n>Black Friday kicks off the frenzied final weeks of the winter holiday shopping season, driving sales that can make or break retailers’ annual profits.\n>\n>This year’s sales come as affordability concerns rise up the US political agenda in the face of stubborn inflation and an uptick in unemployment. Shoppers who planned to tighten their belts cited the higher cost of living and financial constraints, Deloitte said. \n>\n>Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer at Target, said: “As we approach the holidays, we know consumers remain cautious. Sentiment is at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability and tariffs.”\n>\n>“Yet they remain emotionally motivated. They want to celebrate with loved ones without overspending,” he told analysts last week. \n>\n>US retailers now begin Black Friday promotions weeks earlier than the Friday following Thanksgiving as they blend online and digital commerce.\n>\n>Retail giant Walmart is running three sets of deals this month, the third concluding on Monday. Target’s Black Friday event covers the entire week, offering deals such as half price for some Beats headphones, Instant Pot cookware and Barbie dolls. \n>\n>Executives and analysts have acknowledged the strain on some customers in 2025. “What we are seeing is just a lot of uncertainty in the market and people really feeling higher prices,” said Lupine Skelly, retail research leader at Deloitte.\n>\n>At Kohl’s, the US department store chain, “discretionary income remains pressured. This is especially notable in our low to middle-income consumers, as well as in our younger customers,” Michael Bender, its new chief executive, told analysts this week. “The holidays are always a promotional time period, and we expect this to continue this year, especially given the state of the consumer.”  \n>\n>Annual growth in sales is expected to slow slightly during the holiday season spanning November and December, the NRF forecast, to between 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in 2024. Total sales are likely to top $1tn for the first time.\n>\n>Retailers and brands have kicked off promotions well before Thanksgiving. So far this month, online sales have increased by 7.5 per cent year over year to nearly $80bn, according to Adobe Analytics. Comparable data on sales at physical stores is not yet available.\n>\n>Retailers have reported some price rises in order to offset higher costs of imports following the tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on US trading partners this year.\n>\n>Eighty-five per cent of consumers surveyed by the NRF said they expect higher prices for gifts and holiday items because of tariffs. \n>\n>US consumer confidence has dropped to the lowest level since Trump launched the global trade war in April, the Conference Board reported this week, clouding the outlook for future sales.\n>\n>\n>Much of the expected rise in total spending “reflects higher prices, not higher confidence”, according to consultancy Accenture’s holiday shopping survey.\n>\n>Gift cards will be the top Christmas present this year, followed by apparel and toys or games, a consumer survey by market research firm Numerator showed.\n>\n>Skelly at Deloitte said the preference for gift cards likely showed consumers responding to affordability worries. “When people start experiencing higher prices and talking a lot about it, they tend to go to gift cards,” she said. “What happens is, ‘Hey, I’ll buy you the $50 gift card, and you can go buy the $57 sweater.’ It kind of puts the pressure back on the gift recipient.”", "score": 673, "num_comments": 101, "over_18": false, "author": "Prudent-Corgi3793"}

Kazuo Ueda said, stoking hopes that it could resume monetary tightening this year.\n\nThe central bank will pay special attention to the outlook for wage increases, he said in a speech to business leaders Monday in Nagoya, central Japan.\n\nSticky inflation backs the case for higher rates, but as living costs rise policymakers want to see commensurate growth in wages.\n\nUeda said the bank is actively collecting information regarding firms' stance toward pay increases ahead of its next policy-setting meeting scheduled for Dec. 18-19.\n\nAt that meeting--the final one of the year--the BOJ \"will consider the pros and cons of raising the policy interest rate and make decisions as appropriate,\" Ueda said.\n\nWhile policymakers at the central bank have signaled that a rate hike is likely in the near future, market participants and economists have been divided on when it will happen.\n\nPersistent inflation suggests that conditions are becoming ripe for the central bank to make a move, but some economists say Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's preference for expansive economic policies complicates the path to monetary tightening.\n\nThis tension, combined with lingering uncertainty over the full impact of U.S. tariffs and the need for inflation expectations to become firmly anchored, has split views on when the BOJ will act next.\n\nBut after Ueda's remarks on Monday, markets seem to be leaning toward a December hike. The yen recovered against the dollar, reaching around 155.50 in morning trade after weakening to near 157.90 recently. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to 1.850%, the highest since June 2008.\n\nIn response to the speech, Capital Economics changed its call for a January rate hike, now expecting the BOJ to lift its policy rate to 0.75% in December.\n\n\"If the bank does indeed raise its policy rate in a couple of weeks, we'd still expect two more rate hikes in 2026,\" it said in a note.\n\nUeda said raising rates at an appropriate speed won't put the brakes on Japan's economy--rather, it would take the foot off the accelerator enough to achieve growth and price stability.\n\nGradually adjusting interest rates \"will ultimately lead to the success of the efforts undertaken by the government and the bank thus far,\" he said.", "score": 187, "num_comments": 50, "over_18": false, "author": "Worth_Quantity1953"}

EDIT: you are not comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already.\n\nWith an IRR of 3.5% over 30 years that you can access through tax-free loans (loan interest is covered by cash value interests), wouldn't WLI yield decent returns for retirement?

As far as I'm concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bonds-like return-risk profile. In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its tax-deferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value. It also gives optionality for estate planning. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have a solid, sustainable cash flow already (for instance already maxing out all tax-advantaged accounts).

She has given us some good advice and been helpful, considering we knew absolutely nothing about investing when we started our account with her.  She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money, but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETF's that \"her team\" has chosen based on our risk assessment.  I periodically receive buy & sell orders, which is nice to see that the account *is* in-fact being actively managed to a degree, but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the S&P 500, so they're really not beating the market.\n\nWe pay her 1% of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an \"advisors fee\" and currently have roughly $450k in the account.  When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole, but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by - CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started.  I recently (fairly bluntly) asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1% advisors fee we pay if they're not beating the market.  She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was \"the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds, retirement goals, tax deference strategies, etc.\".  Okay, all makes sense and is respected, but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my son's 529 and she told me \"we don't do that\".  What she meant was they don't have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity, and therefore couldn't make their 1% on it.  That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives, fees, etc.  But I ended up having to do all the research myself, which I realized wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would have been.  Still though, would have been nice if the $4,500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself...\n\nI'm starting to feel - especially from reading others' sentiments on this subreddit - that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected, and/or for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves - i.e. have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25% and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear.\n\nMy wife and I are both very young and, barring nothing unexpected, should not need this money for quite a long time.  As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not touch it for another 25+ years.  Over that much time, that 1% fee we're paying adds up to a good chunk of money, esp. when factoring in compounding interest.  I'm not trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible, esp. if there is good reason to be paying it.  But it's certainly not nothing, and I wouldn't mind it if I felt like we were actually *getting* something for paying it.\n\nIs this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1% back into our pocket and just do something like VT & chill?  Or do I just stay the course, let her and her team continue \"managing\" everything, and when if/when we need the help I have someone readily available to me?", "score": 100, "num_comments": 223, "over_18": false, "author": "markprice211"}

The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly.\n\nIntel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.", "score": 53, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "author": "MarketFlux"}
