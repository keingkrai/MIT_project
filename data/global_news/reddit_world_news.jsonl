Do not manage your portfolio daily, manage it monthly at most. **Every time you buy OR sell an option you are losing money to the market makers.** Everybody on here will give advice to \"lock in gains\" or \"roll to a new position\" if you're up, when in reality you're bleeding money to hedge fund algorithms every time you make any trade at all. Trading options at all is inherently a losing game, but if you want to minimize the money you pay to market makers, simply make fewer trades. If you start with 1k and put it into options: imagine paying like 3-10% of that to market makers every time you reinvest it (on average) — so if you reinvest the same money 5 times, you are essentially 'paying' 15-40% of your expected value to algorithms/market makers. I sometimes think that the hedge funds themselves are in this sub astroturfing to get people to trade daily because it's so profitable for them.\n2. Human emotion is your greatest weakness. There are algorithms that are literally designed to manipulate retail traders into panic buying or selling. **If you ever want to make a trade, WAIT 24H** and if you still want to do it the next day, go for it. Retail traders never have knowledge before the big funds, so there is NEVER a rush to make a trade.

The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”\n\n>While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”\n\n>It’s unclear how much of this “demand” Google mentioned represents organic user interest in AI capabilities versus the company integrating AI features into existing services like Search, Gmail, and Workspace. But whether users are using the features voluntarily or not, Google isn’t the only tech company struggling to keep up with a growing user base of customers using AI services.\n\n>Major tech companies are in a race to build out data centers. Google competitor OpenAI is planning to build six massive data centers across the US through its Stargate partnership project with SoftBank and Oracle, committing over $400 billion in the next three years to reach nearly 7 gigawatts of capacity. The company faces similar constraints serving its 800 million weekly ChatGPT users, with even paid subscribers regularly hitting usage limits for features like video synthesis and simulated reasoning models.\n\n>“The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,” Vahdat said at the meeting, according to CNBC’s viewing of the presentation. The infrastructure executive explained that Google’s challenge goes beyond simply outspending competitors. “We’re going to spend a lot,” he said, but noted the real objective is building infrastructure that is “more reliable, more performant and more scalable than what’s available anywhere else.”\n\n>The thousandfold scaling challenge\n\n>One major bottleneck for meeting AI demand has been Nvidia’s lack of capacity to produce enough GPUs that accelerate AI computations. Just a few days ago during a quarterly earnings report, Nvidia said its AI chips are “sold out” as it races to meet demand that grew its data center revenue by $10 billion in a single quarter.\n\n>The lack of chips and other infrastructure constraints affects Google’s ability to deploy new AI features. During the all-hands meeting on November 6, Google CEO Sundar Pichai cited the example of Veo, Google’s video generation tool that received an upgrade last month. “When Veo launched, how exciting it was,” Pichai said. “If we could’ve given it to more people in the Gemini app, I think we would have gotten more users but we just couldn’t because we are at a compute constraint.”\n\n>At the same meeting, Vahdat’s presentation outlined how Google plans to achieve its massive scaling targets without simply throwing money at the problem. The company plans to rely on three main strategies: building physical infrastructure, developing more efficient AI models, and designing custom silicon chips.\n\n>Using its own chips means Google does not need to completely rely on Nvidia hardware to build out its AI capabilities. Earlier this month, for example, Google announced the general availability of its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) called Ironwood. Google claims it is “nearly 30x more power efficient” than its first Cloud TPU from 2018.\n\n>Given widespread acknowledgment of a potential AI industry bubble, including extended remarks by Pichai in a recent BBC interview, the aggressive plans for AI data center expansion reflect Google’s calculation that the risk of underinvesting exceeds the risk of overcapacity. But it’s a bet that could prove costly if demand doesn’t continue to increase as expected.\n\n>At the all-hands meeting, Pichai told employees that 2026 will be “intense,” citing both AI competition and pressure to meet cloud and compute demand. Pichai directly addressed employee concerns about a potential AI bubble, acknowledging the topic has been “definitely in the zeitgeist.”", "score": 2862, "num_comments": 597, "over_18": false, "author": "callsonreddit"}

If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” he told employees. “If we were off by just a hair, if it looked even a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart.”\n>\n>The comments offer a rare glimpse into how the face of the AI boom views the growing backlash to it, and how closely he is watching the market’s whiplash response.\n>A blowout quarter that spooked investors\n>\n>On paper, Nvidia gave investors about everything they had asked for. The chipmaker reported another surge in sales of its data-center processors, the workhorses that power large AI models (and Nvidia’s revenues), and raised its guidance for the current quarter. It was the kind of performance expected to kick off another six-month rally, investors were saying. \n>\n>Instead, the stock’s initial jump gave way to a broad selloff. Nvidia climbed as much as 5% early in Thursday’s session before closing down roughly 3%, as traders rotated out of the Big Tech names most closely associated with the AI boom. \n>\n>The reversal extended what has become a bruising stretch for the so-called AI trade. After months of a breathless rally, investors are increasingly anxious that tech giants are spending too aggressively on data centers, GPUs, and networking gear, with no guarantee they can earn enough revenue to get those investments back. Some are also focusing on the complex, debt-heavy financing structures behind the AI infrastructure build-out, with credit markets starting to flash early warning signs.\n>\n>Layered on top of that are fresh macro jitters. A shutdown-delayed U.S. jobs report, released the same morning, showed stronger-than-expected hiring in September, but a higher unemployment rate; this conflicting data did little to clarify whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December.\n>\n>Some investors are closely watching different statements from Fed presidents to try to read the tea leaves, but with the earnings season winding down and no obvious catalyst between now and the Fed’s next decision, it appears that many other investors are using the volatility to lock in profits from the year’s earlier rally—and get out of the market.\n>\n>“The broader narrative hasn’t broken; it’s simply being tested right now,” Mark Hackett at Nationwide told Bloomberg. “Periods like this often act as a release valve rather than signaling a true trend reversal. \n>‘We’re basically holding the planet together‘\n>\n>Inside Nvidia, Huang suggested no one should be surprised that investors are jumpy when so much of the AI story is being projected onto a single company.\n>\n>He referenced online memes that jokingly describe Nvidia as the linchpin of the global economy and **the only thing standing between the U.S. and recession**.\n>\n>“Have you guys seen some of them?” he asked employees. “We’re basically holding the planet together—and it’s not untrue.”\n>\n>That level of mythos has helped propel Nvidia’s market value into the stratosphere, making it the world’s most valuable public company. But Huang made clear that it has also turned every earnings day into a high-wire act.\n>\n>“The expectations are so high that if we miss by just a little bit, people think the whole story is broken,” he said.\n>\n>Still, Huang pushed back on the idea that Nvidia is responsible for the frothier parts of the AI trade. The company’s job, he emphasized, is to build the compute infrastructure others need, not to police how the market prices demand.\n>\n>Amidst the pressure, Huang kept the meeting light with whistling-past-the-graveyard-esqe humor about Nvidia’s wild swings.\n>\n>He joked about the “good old days” when the company had a $5 trillion market capitalization, a playful exaggeration of its actual peak valuation—before noting just how much value has evaporated in recent weeks.\n>\n>“Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks,” he said. “You’ve got to be worth a lot to lose $500 billion in a few weeks.”\n>\n>Huang told employees he was “delighted” by the quarter and proud of their work, stressing the company’s underlying business remains strong even if markets are punishing them for it.", "score": 2075, "num_comments": 212, "over_18": false, "author": "Prudent-Corgi3793"}

Google used its own processors *(TPUs)* and not Nvidia chips to train the Gemini 3 model. This means Google has just leapfrogged OpenAI in the competition, and the structural advantages are now becoming evident.\n\n* Google has 4 billion users across Search, YouTube, and Gmail who generate valuable training data for their models. Compared to this, all the data OpenAI uses must either be scraped from the web *(which raises copyright issues)* or acquired from other companies *(which worsens their margins)*.\n\n\n\n* The TPUs that Google used for training their latest model are designed by Google itself and integrated directly into Google’s data centers. While there are rumors that TPUs are better for machine learning workloads as they are custom-designed *(vis-a-vis GPUs)*, the critical point is that Google can avoid Nvidia's premium *(Nvidia has a 75% margin on its chips)* that OpenAI has to pay.\n\n\n\n* Finally, Gemini is gaining market share rapidly. Now that they have the best model and lower generation costs, they can instantly distribute it to their 4 billion-user base, thereby undercutting OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. Most users don’t care which AI they use as long as it gets the job done.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpgw3eaoaf3g1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5011b1b264e5c34a97cce1e9ed695e76b5f02e\n\nWe are not even getting into how much better Alphabet's financial position is compared to OpenAI's. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6hoT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4841cd7f-9e78-4f2d-87ba-d9faf2b78ec1_956x760.jpeg)", "score": 2035, "num_comments": 340, "over_18": false, "author": "reboundcapital"}

But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers.\n\nDocuments filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon’s home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies.\n\nThe figures represent a segment of the total layoffs announced in October. Not all data was immediately available because of differences in state WARN reporting requirements.\n\nIn announcing the steepest round of cuts in its 31-year history, Amazon joined a growing roster of tech companies that have slashed jobs this year even as cash piles have mounted and profits soared. In total, there have been almost 113,000 job cuts at 231 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, continuing a trend that began in 2022 as businesses readjusted to life after the Covid pandemic.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear mission to transform the company’s corporate culture into one that operates like what he calls “the world’s largest startup.” He’s looked to make Amazon leaner and less bureaucratic by urging staffers to do more with less and cutting organizational bloat.\n\nAmazon is expected to carry out further job reductions in January, CNBC previously reported.\n\nThe company said it’s also shifting resources to invest more in artificial intelligence. The technology is already poised to reshape Amazon’s white-collar workforce, with Jassy predicting in June that its corporate head count will shrink in the coming years alongside efficiency gains from AI.\n\nHuman resources chief Beth Galetti, in her memo announcing the layoffs, focused on the importance of innovating, which the company will now have to do with fewer people, specifically engineers.\n\n“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”\n\nAmazon said in a statement that AI is not the driver behind the vast majority of the job cuts, and that the bigger goal was to reduce bureaucracy and emphasize speed.\n\nJassy said on Amazon’s earnings call last month that the cuts were in response to a “culture” issue inside the company, spurred in part by an extended hiring spree that left it with “a lot more layers” and slower decision-making.\n\nThe layoffs impacted a mix of software engineer levels, but SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were disproportionately affected, the WARN filings show.\n\nThe AI boom is making software development jobs harder to come by as companies adopt coding assistants or so-called vibe coding platforms from vendors like Cursor, OpenAI and Cognition. Amazon has released its own competitor called Kiro.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/amazon-cut-thousands-of-engineers-in-its-record-layoffs-filings-show.html", "score": 906, "num_comments": 77, "over_18": false, "author": "Puginator"}

Youre seeing those neon green vertical lines of SPY and GOOG and saying, pfft another dumb bear coming along to ruin the fun, and for now, you’re absolutely right. Ride the bubble while you can, but I think we can all agree that this is not sustainable by any means. Gold isn’t king because of the AI bubble shenanigans, gold is king because of the US sovereign debt. I know what you’re thinking, another boring debt doomer saying “the end is neigh”, but this isn’t just a problem for next generation, or next decade, the debt is about to be a problem literally a couple months from now. This is because of the looming US sovereign debt wall of 2026-2028, which is a mathematically guaranteed certainty. The term “debt wall” isn’t a shorthand way of saying, “gee, we sure do owe a lot of money”, this is “the interest on this debt is going to literally go vertical”. How did this happen why should I care? Here’s the gist: \n\nDuring COVID we borrowed an obscene amount of money, we all know this. We looked back on the deflationary crashes of ye olden times of 1929/2008 and said no thank you, and we chose inflation. A fair choice given the circumstances. Rates were slashed to basically nothing, and both the US treasury well as companies locked in huge huge loans of basically free money given that the interest rate was lower than inflation. Those debts were dated at 5 years, and were finally arriving at their payback date. \n\n-2026 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-2027 maturities: 7.3 trillion\n\n-2028 maturities: 9.5 trillion\n\n-total to refinance: 25.8 TRILLION dollars \n\nNow you may be saying “how can 26/38 trillion dollars of our debt be due in The next 3 years?” The answer is because treasury secretary Janet Yellen intentionally prevented longer term bonds from being issued in 2023-2024 and flooded the market with short term T bills. This equated to 33% of all of our debt having maturity dates under 12 months. This makes our financial situation basically entirely dependant on short term changes in the interest rate. \n\nOf course, the US treasury cannot pay this money back, and thus it has to procrastinate the problem by paying it off using new debt, debt which is now at an interest rate of 4-4.5%. In 2025 our interest payments on our debt, that is, the money we pay just to stay neutral, was almost 1 trillion dollars (970 billion to be exact). This is more than the entire budget of our military, you know, the one that’s larger than the combined military spending of China, Russia, Germany, India, UK, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, France, and Japan. In 2026 alone, overnight, this refinancing will raise our interest payments on the debt by 237 billion dollars. \n\nThe congressional budget office estimated the interest payments on our debt will reach 2.6 trillion dollars by 2035, and this is assuming no new wars and no recessions at all (impossible considering the shadow debt and private equity vampires pulling a 2008 two, electric boogaloo, but let’s just ignore that for now)\n\nWhen the interest hits just 1.5 trillion, it will consume somewhere between 30-40% of our entire federal income. This is a mathematically guaranteed doomsday level of bad. The passing of the BBB has shown that we have absolutely zero interest (pun intended) in actually dealing with this problem, and the fact the government was incapable of even passing a budget and chose to shutdown for its longest period ever shows this as well. The debt is effectively unpayable, so what happens now? We have 2 choices.\n\n1. The honest path (deflationary crash). We repay our debt at the fair market rate to compensate for the incoming inflation explosion and refinance our debt at its fair value of 6-7%\n- What happens: the interest payments bankrupt the federal reserve and a failed treasury auction happens. We basically default on our debt and the financial system of the world implodes. Not going to happen. \n1. The dishonest default (inflationary melt up). The fed implements financial repression, that is, printing trillions of dollars that the market won’t buy, thus artificially lowering interest rates to 3-4% even when inflation is at 8-10%\n- What happens: the government stays solvent at the cost of burning its currency. The dollar js debased to pay our debts with worthless money.\n\nYou can kiss that duel mandate of the Fed goodby. You can’t exactly be “politically independent” when your choices are to raise rates and stop inflation and blow up the financial market of the world, or to allow for your own existence to continue and inflate away the debt. We are currently in a stagflationary market analogous to the 1970’s, with little to no broad economic growth discounting the AI hype bubble. We would be in a recession if it weren’t for AI spending. Don’t believe me? Do you believe JP Morgan and Barclays? \n- https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/markets-and-economy/top-market-takeaways/tmt-in-the-rear-view-how-did-our-2025-themes-pan-out)\n- Q1 2026 Global Outlook | Barclays Investment Bank\n\nWe have no real growth, and official inflation is 3%, far higher than our supposed goal of 2%. We all know that this number is not actually real anyways though, anyone who isn’t a billionaire and has bought anything in the few years can tell you things are getting debilitatingly expensive. Inflation numbers are a lie, and that isn’t some tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, the Bureau of Labor Statistics legitimately changed the CPI from being a “cost of goods index” to a “cost of living index”, instead measuring the cost to maintain a certain level of satisfaction. This basically means a whole bunch of shenanigans which translates to ultimately say, the official inflation numbers are not real and haven’t been for a long time. Use this nifty website to see just how ridiculous the new measuring system is: https://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts\n\nAnyways, back to the 70s, the quintessential example of stagflation. What wins when your currency is going down the drain? Well, the run-up means a whole lot of rampant buying of speculative investments, that is to say, bubbles. We’re not in an AI bubble we’re in an everything bubble. It is not normal for gold, bitcoin, and the S&P to all be at ATH, it’s not because they’re suddenly the best thing ever, it’d because cash is a guaranteed loss. And this charade likely won’t end, at least for a little while, it’s mighty hard to pop a bubble when rates are decreasing, and given the debt wall and the impossible situation the Fed is in you can bet your bottom (soon to be worthless) dollar that interest rates will keep getting cut.\n\nSo what, bubble this bubble that, why is this important? We’re all making plenty of money with those glorious green candles anyways right? Well, what goes up must come down unfortunately, and we can take a look back at the stock market of the 70s once more. There was an exact equivalent of the current Mag 7 called the Nifty Fifty, companies like Disney, IBM, Xerox, companies considered so untouchable that the price didn’t matter. Unfathomable P/E ratios of over 50, but when the degree of the inflation problem was finally understood in 1973-1974, the market crashed 50-80%. \n\nMoney fled to hard assets, land, energy, and most importantly, our old friend Gold. Gold ran up alongside everything else in the “everything bubble” phase of the early 70s, doubling from 35-70 dollars, but when the crash happened and everything else dumped Gold was standing tall at 200. However, this wasn’t the end though, things really got cooking in the late 70s when the inflationary crack up really hit and gold went up to 850 dollars per ounce. So you ask, how did we get out of it in the 70s?   In order to stop the compounding inflation and halt the free-fall loss of faith in the dollar, the Fed Chairmen Paul Volcker at the time raised rates all the way up to 20%, crushing inflation and causing a recession, which although painful, broke the inflationary spiral. It is impossible to do this now, as our debt to GDP ratio was only 30% at the time, if it were to happen now it would be choosing option 1, which isn’t possible for reasons stated prior.\n\nIt’s a lot to take in, I know. You might not believe me, and that’s ok, but just look at the smart money. Central banks are buying gold at rates not seen in decades, the holdings for gold just exceeded US Treasury reserves for the first time since 1996. Even if you still don’t believe me and think AI is going to save the world and deliver the perfect, exponential growth the financial markets demand of it, this entire multi trillion dollar narrative depends entirely on a single company on a small island right off the coast of the second most powerful country in the world, who has it baked into its very existence that its primary goal is to “unify” Taiwan back into it. The same country that has officially stated that its army must be capable of invasion by 2026, the same country whose 77 year old totalitarian leader has stated that the Taiwan problem is not generational and must be solved within his lifetime. The same country facing a demographic cliff so steep that it basically guarantees it will be unable to ever make an attempt at Taiwan unless it does so in the decade. If Taiwan is invaded or even blockaded the financial effects would be beyond comprehension. We are talking 2 or maybe 3 times as bad as 2008 overnight. You know what’s a great asset during uncertainty, volatility and war? Gold. \n\nYou probably looked at this wall of text, rolled your eyes, and scrolled to the bottom, heck maybe you even skimmed through. You don’t have to read it if you don’t want to, the TLDR summary is this: you should keep some double digit percentage of your portfolio in gold. Let me know if you think I’m wrong and why I would really love to learn. Thanks for taking the time to read what I wrote. \n\nPositions: basically entirely PHYS\n\n     PS. stay away from GLD, it’s taxed at a far far higher rate and it’s not directly tied to a physical piece of gold.

Russia defaulted, Long Term Capital Management collapsed, and everyone panicked. Traders who'd gotten comfortable watching tech stocks climb just saw their gains disappear overnight.\n\nBut by October? The selloff was over. What came next was actually one of the strongest rallies ever. That brutal '98 drop wasn't the end of the bull market, it was just a nasty shakeout before the final push into early 2000. Markets were already stretched, but they still had room to run.\n\nFeels kinda similar to now.\n\nLast week, Alphabet released Gemini 3 Pro and it's a pretty big deal. Instead of the GPUs everyone's been talking about, it uses TPUs, tensor processing units. They're specialized chips that can only do AI math, but that makes them incredibly fast and energy efficient.\n\nThe performance improvements over the previous version were huge. And it shows AI still has plenty of room to grow as long as the chips and algorithms keep getting better.\n\nSo yeah, we might be in a '98 situation. Market looks stretched, there's been some shakiness, but the underlying tech story is still solid. Of course, nobody knows for sure, but the parallels are interesting.\n\nWhat do you think?

For Nvidia, this doesn’t change its dominant position today, but it does show that big AI players are at least exploring alternatives instead of relying 100% on GPUs.\nIs this just Meta hedging its options, or could we actually see large AI companies start moving workloads away from Nvidia over the next few years?", "score": 293, "num_comments": 58, "over_18": false, "author": "Illustrious_Lie_954"}

Currently, the tech giant leases its TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to AI developers through Google Cloud. This means these chips are confined to Google's own data centers and are not sold externally, contrary to reports by The Information.\n\nThe report also indicates Google is now marketing TPUs to its other cloud customers, with the company claiming this move could potentially capture up to 10% of Nvidia's annual revenue. Following this news, shares of Nvidia's competitor AMD (AMD) fell by more than 8%.\n\nThis move reflects a growing trend where Nvidia's largest customers are becoming some of its biggest competitive threats.\n\nBeyond Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have also developed their own AI chips. Amazon recently completed a major data center project, leasing its custom-built 500,000 AI chips to Anthropic, one of the leading AI developers. Google recently announced a major partnership with Anthropic (ANTH.PVT), while OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) reportedly tested the company's AI chips this summer.\n\nIn recent months, speculation has grown that Google is expanding its artificial intelligence chip business to compete more directly with Nvidia.\n\nIn a September report, investment firm DA Davidson noted that “several prominent cutting-edge AI labs” have shown “strong interest” in acquiring Google's TPUs. The firm estimates Google's TPU business and its AI division DeepMind could be worth as much as $90 billion.\n\nNVIDIA's stock declined on the latest news, erasing earlier gains in tech shares on Monday as the sector began rebounding from a steep decline. Both NVIDIA and other major tech stocks have faced pressure in recent months amid growing concerns about an AI bubble.\n\nNVIDIA has faced criticism for its circular AI transactions the leading AI chipmaker invests in its own customers while famed “big short” investor Michael Burry recently bet on the company's decline, claiming the AI market resembles the dot com bubble.\n\nHowever, the company sought to dispel some of these concerns in a memo sent to Wall Street analysts over the weekend.\n\n“NVIDIA is fully transparent about its strategic investments... Companies in NVIDIA's strategic portfolio are rapidly growing their own revenues, indicating they are on a path to profitability and demonstrating strong underlying customer demand for AI applications,” the company stated in a memo obtained by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also specifically rebutted critics who have drawn parallels to past accounting scandals, writing: “NVIDIA bears no resemblance to historical accounting frauds because our underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is fully transparent, and we place a premium on our reputation for integrity.”\n\nNVIDIA elaborated on why it believes itself fundamentally different from companies like Enron, WorldCom, or Lucent.", "score": 107, "num_comments": 23, "over_18": false, "author": "Aluseda"}
