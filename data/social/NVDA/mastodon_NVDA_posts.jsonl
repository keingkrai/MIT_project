{"who": "Tech Singer", "when": "2025-11-24T20:16:03+00:00", "content": "Ok, so this is another of those weird questions which I post because people here use their brains more than most. I want to have one NVDA Remote client control two machines at the same time. That is, I want my laptop to control my desktop and my second desktop, but I want both desktop1 and desktop2 to have their NVDA heard through the laptop at the same time. I also want to switch back and forth between the two machines, as well as to and from the laptop itself, with a keystroke. There are two solutions I've found for this, but both are a bit of a mess. I can use thenvdaremote://  URLs to disconnect from desktop1 and connect to desktop2 with one keystroke, and have another keystroke to do the reverse. The problem there is that I can't hear both machines' NVDA at  the same time. Also, and this isn't as big a deal, I'm just a perfectionist, switching takes a few seconds. Secondly, I can run a virtual machine and have that connected to desktop2, with the host machine connected to desktop1. That allows easy switching of the keyboard,  just alt+tab to the VM window and hit ctrl+g when I want to control desktop2. It also allows both desktops to have their NVDA run through the speaker at the same time and also, which is very nice, allows braille to swap with any display which supports channels. The problem there is the latency of the VM audio, which I  can't seem to shrink. It seems a bit overkill, I may say, to run an entire windows OS just for NVDA remote in a VM. Does anyone have any better solutions. Can anyone think of something which would get all three things running, fast switching, simultaneous NVDA, and no latency? Ideas would be very gratefully received and boosts would be appreciated. #NVDA #blind #a11y #screenreader #remote #nvdaremote", "url": "https://tweesecake.social/@techsinger/115606510843063710", "id": "115606510873696749", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}

Accentize Reviver Pro installs but I can't find it anywhere on my computer, so I had to uninstall it.  Basically, the two best tools for the job are completely inaccessible to the blind.  i have heard of something called Reaper, which does have accessible plug-ins that work with NVDA (my screen reader) but I have no idea if any of it actually restores frequencies and such.  I did, however, receive some general recommendations from Perplexity, and they seem very reasonable, so I will include them here.  This is the quick version.\"Summary Table of Frequency Restoration Goals\nFrequency Range\nImportance\nEffect of Restoration\n50–200 Hz\nAdds warmth and fullness\nRestores body and resonance\n200 Hz–1 kHz\nVocal clarity and timbre\nEnhances natural voice and instrument tones\n1–5 kHz\nPresence and articulation\nImproves vocal “edge” and attack on piano\"I also found this to be interesting.\"Practical Considerations\n• \nRestoration is a balancing act; too much boost in any range can introduce noise or unnaturality.\n• \nAnalogue equalizers and cautious digital EQs are well suited to restore missing lows and midrange.\n• \nAI spectral recovery tools focus mainly on boosting upper frequencies and “filling in” missing detail but cannot authentically recreate absent low-end.\n• \nListening carefully and comparing before-and-after versions remains the best guide.\nYour focus on naturalness and historical authenticity aligns perfectly with this frequency approach: restoring warmth and clarity without over-processing the treble region is key.\"To learn more about my project, you can check this link.

NVDA is free, easy to use (within the context of desktop screen readers), and it's good enough for the vast majority of screen reader users. Want to browse the web? Want to check your email? Need to type up an assignment? Need to track data with spreadsheets? Want to write some code? Want to run virtual machines? Just wanna keep up with your communities on Discord? Want to test your app for accessibility? NVDA can do all of those things. There is no faffing, no caveats, no running obscure commands, and no license to install. You download it. You install it. You run it. That's it. Want it to do more stuff? Open the addon store which is built into NVDA. If you know Python, you can write your own addons and share them with other users.\nFS is relying on organizations like schools and governments where paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars is normal and expected and you can't just install an addon to an existing app. This does not work outside of those organizations. The blind kid who wants to listen to memes and keep up with their friends doesn't have several hundred dollars per year, but they probably know that they can go download a free screen reader that will let them listen to memes and keep up with their friends.\nNVDA is winning because it's good enough for most people and costs nothing. If you do have the money to spare for a license and you want to use JAWS because you prefer it, that's fantastic! I'm glad you found a screen reader that you like. Most people will choose the free option because they just wanna listen to their favorite streamer while they type up their research paper.\n#blind #AccessForAll #ScreenReader #nvda #jaws #jaws26", "url": "https://meow.social/@PepperTheVixen/115465058273160093", "id": "115465058314505777", "source": "mastodon#hashtag", "symbol": "NVDA"}

For example, I got the latest version of StemRoller which is 3.0.0 but for some reason, it won't let me get past the Windows defender smart screen, where I can hit run anyway. The screen reader in my case which is #NVDA will say window dialogue, and stay there for about 40 seconds before returning to the downloads folder. Because you need to run the application so that way you can extractit. In addition, I downloaded space defender, which is an audio game made by @tunmi13. I was able to extract all the contents into a folder, but doesn't run. Instead of staying on the window dialogue for a while and returning to the folder, it just doesn't run. However, it does work on 24H2 because I tried it on another device. I can get past the windows defender, smart screen, and start playing or using any app that is extracted to a folder.
