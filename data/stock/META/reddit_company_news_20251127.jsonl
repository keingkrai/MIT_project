Still radio silence.  Completely dead on the radio.  \n**EDIT 316: 7:30PM** Two choppers in the air (according to whatever news station I have on TV - NOT THE SCANNER) with infrared cameras.  \n**EDIT 315: 7:29PM** Still mumblings about dogs and weapons, no brand new information.  Still attempting radio silence for the TAC squads.  \n**EDIT 314: 7:28PM** Suspect is in the boat and he has a wire fence behind him.  Trying to decipher chatter here as quickly as I can.  Sorry if I miss something.  \n**EDIT 313: 7:27PM** One friendly is \"a little too close\" to the boat.  Asking them to leave.  \n**EDIT 312: 7:26PM** \"Suspect prone\"  Not sure if I heard that right.  There is still movement in the back of the boat.  \n**EDIT 311: 7:26PM** They are attempting to come up with an official dog to track down the suspect in case he gets out of the boat.  FBI dog versus BPD dog?  I pick the FBI dog.  \n**EDIT 310: 7:25PM** Tactical folk trying to get up on a wall for either entry or line of sight.  They have a K9 unit on hand as well.  \n**EDIT 309: 7:23PM** \"Clear the air.  Let's maintain radio silence.\"  \"OK boss, we're in the house.\"  \n**EDIT 308: 7:22PM** \"Keep going dispatch, you guys are doing a great job.\"  \n**EDIT 307: 7:22PM** All non-tactical policemen are asked to leave the area.  Those with the best weapons are in place and they want them to have the best view of the incident.  \n**EDIT 306: 7:21PM** [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cpb55/live_boston_update_thread_part_7/c9ir3y9) filled in while I was gone.  THANK YOU!  \n**EDIT 286: 7:19PM** The backyard has been cleared of all officers and civilians in case of crossfire.  Apparent standoff situation - will continue to update quickly.  The scanner is very busy.  \n**EDIT 285: 7:17PM** If the boat is in fact opened, officers are to be wary of crossfire.  EMS is being called.  Passerbys are advising multiple people are running.  Unsure if they are civilian or not.\n**EDIT 284: 7:16PM** All non-essential officers are being asked to set up a perimeter.  They are ripping off something...not sure what.  I think he is hiding in a boat.\n**EDIT 283: 7:16PM** Garage is clear.  I have a scanner up and I will update by the moment from here on out until the conclusion.  \n**EDIT 282: 7:15PM** Shots fired.  Suspect possibly down.  Ambulance being backed in.  \"All police officers form all commands in the rear of that white garage behind the house need to move.  You are in the line of fire.\"   \n**EDIT 281: 7:14PM** Stupid traffic...sorry guys.  Police and FBI have tracked down a car. Shots fired at 7:09.  EOD on scene.\n**EDIT 280: 6:49PM** Since the scanners aren't working for me here at work, I'm going to go rush home and see if I can get them back up there.  10-15 minutes, I promise.  \n**EDIT 279: 6:46PM** Reports of a suspect in custody.  No description, name, location, or anything else.  I can not even hint at it being the primary suspect.  \n**EDIT 278: 6:45PM** I have been sent a recording of the potential high speed chase by /u/That_Urks_Me and it seems as plausible as the other scanner audio I have found.  Thank you to everyone that has sent me scanner links, I think I have one that is working for now.\n**EDIT 277: 6:42PM** Mention of a possible runner.  (This was potentially of a recorded audio - apologies)  \n**EDIT 276: 6:40PM** Unconfirmed reports of high speed chase matching a vehicle description.  My scanners are all down so I think it's a good time for me to run home and find a new one.  Staying for a little while longer in case something happens.  \n**EDIT 275: 6:37PM** Delayed edit from 6:32 from /u/extrasweettea \"Male on bike wearing all black with curly hair seen on bike going towards central square with large backpack.. Units deployed.\"  \n**EDIT 274: 6:34PM** My scanner went down so I'm looking for a new one.  **PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING SCANNER LINKS.** Also, I will be heading home soon from work so I will be out of updates for about 15 minutes.  I will let you know when I leave and when I get back  \n**EDIT 273: 6:28PM** More questions about civilians entering the streets and how to handle the situation.  Questions about traffic patterns and allowable areas are being discussed.  \n**EDIT 272: 6:24PM** Possible sighting of the suspect in **[REDACTED]**.  Police are sending units to investigate.  \n**EDIT 271: 6:23PM** Police on **[REDACTED]** street say that federal agents and other agencies are falling back and the perimeter is getting sparse.  \n**EDIT 270: 6:18PM** Delayed edit from 6:12 from /u/extrasweettea \"Vehicle was left with clerk after being given $20 to park it in unknown parking lot. Was told someone would come by at 10 to pick it up. No keys were left.\"  \n**EDIT 269: 6:16PM** Suspicious knapsack found.  EOD requested.  Unsure of location but I believe Watertown.  \n**EDIT 268: 6:15PM** Police are seeing people leaving their houses and requesting how to act.
