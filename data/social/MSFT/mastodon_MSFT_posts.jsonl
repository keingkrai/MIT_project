None of that AI stuff, unless you purposefully install it. IMHO Windows is great for gaming (tho many of my titles run on Linux now. Yay!), and in the enterprise of course (where I get my paycheck lol), and that's it. Something to keep in mind, W10 hits EOL this October, so it won't be patched further after then. #APT groups will increase attacks using #0days once MSFT ceases official support exponentially.You can still disable #Copilot in the registry of W11 24H3 (Pro and Enterprise SKUs, not Home as far as I can find). Not sure how long that will last though as #MSFT pushes hard to further integrate AI in everything they offer. At least on the Enterprise side they give us #sysadmins control over a lot of that. Consumers have much less control. It's either you embrace it, or change to a different platform. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Linux is the only non-AI embedded OS left that I'm aware of. The next release of #macOS has #AppleIntelligence built in, #iOS 18.0 and later has it baked in, the latest release of #ChromeOS for Enterprise has #Gemini baked in, and #Android13 has #Gemini baked in on supported devices. As you know, W10 has Copilot optional with supporting hardware, W11 is baked in but can be toggled off. W12 will be a fully AI-OS. Even still, if you're running any of the latest #IntelUltra processors, they have AI built-in at the hardware level. The new #AMDRyzen processors are doing the same.I decided to embrace the AI evolution rather than fight it. I use my knowledge and skills to protect myself, my family, and my company as much as is possible, and keep abreast of developments in the sector...I also use AI for #cyberdefense.

But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: #EnergyConsumption [and #WaterConsumption].\"#AI #DataCenters use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze.\"But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into #NuclearPower.\"Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either.
