Two months later, the market is telling a different story. Oracle's stock has crashed, wiping out roughly $315 billion in market value more value destroyed than the entire deal was supposed to be worth.​\n\nThe real warning sign is in the credit default swaps chart. These are insurance policies against corporate bankruptcy  and Oracle's costs have more than doubled to two year highs. When this bankruptcy insurance gets expensive, it means Wall Street thinks there's real risk Oracle can't pay its bills.​\n\nHere's the problem though Oracle already carries $104 billion in debt and needs to spend $80 billion per year building AI data centers to fulfill this deal. They're financing this almost entirely through debt expected to nearly double their net debt to $290 billion by 2028. Meanwhile, OpenAI is supposed to pay Oracle $60 billion annually but OpenAI only made $13 billion in total revenue in 2025 and isn't profitable yet. The startup is essentially supposed to spend five times more on Oracle than it makes in revenue.​\n\nIf OpenAI can't secure continued funding or the AI hype deflates, Oracle is stuck with hundreds of billions in infrastructure nobody can pay for. OpenAI may not be a customer that can pay their obligations. Some are even comparing Oracle's credit default swap levels to banks in mid-2007 right before the financial crisis.", "score": 4546, "num_comments": 277, "over_18": false, "author": "Quixotus"}

They’re staring at 1999-style trailing P/E charts or pre-1990s valuation norms and declaring “this time is different” as if that’s automatically a bad thing. In reality, this time really is different – and the data backs it up.\nLook at the Magnificent 7 specifically:\n\t•\tForward P/E ratios are surprisingly moderate given the growth rates we’re seeing\n\t•\tPEG ratios (P/E divided by expected growth) are actually lower than they’ve been at many points in the past decade and significantly lower than the rest of the S&P 493\nWe’re not paying 1999 multiples for 1999 growth – we’re paying reasonable (or even cheap) multiples for a completely different quality of business.\nThe core reason we’ll never return to pre-1990s valuation levels: the economy has shifted from tangible to intangible assets. Intellectual property, network effects, proprietary datasets, and software moats compound in ways steel mills and railroads never could. These assets get better and cheaper to scale every year instead of depreciating.\nOn AI specifically – the bear case that “AI won’t monetize” misses the bigger picture. Direct AI revenue might concentrate in a handful of players (Nvidia, the cloud hyperscalers, etc.), but the second-order effect is massive OPEX compression across every industry. Translation: companies will need far fewer employees to generate the same (or more) revenue.\nYou might lose your job… but the companies you own will be dramatically more profitable because of it. “You’ll own nothing, be replaced by a model, and be happy.”\nBears who keep waiting for a return to 15× earnings are going to be waiting a very long time.

This is no surprise to many and certainly should be no surprise to the street which means that it will already be priced in.\n\nThe real question is what is the **magnitude** of the beat (in forward guidance). If the beat is significantly higher, there is a real chance that Nvidia stock takes a leap upwards.\n\nI happen to believe that Nvidia will have a **blowout earnings** and beat significantly to the upside. This also shouldn’t come as a surprise given the amount of capex that has been spent thus far by the hyperscalers and slew of deal announcements recently.\n\nAlthough I don’t usually make stock price predictions on earnings release, I think that **Nvidia stock price will initially shoot upwards on earnings beat and then fade away over the next couple of days**, similar to what we’ve seen with Oracle and Amazon. \n\nThe current market sentiment doesn’t support for a sustained stock price upside on Nvidia but if the earnings beat is strong enough, there is a chance that it could turn the market sentiment into a bullish one. \n\nEither way, be careful out there and remember to manage your position size appropriately!", "score": 97, "num_comments": 62, "over_18": false, "author": "midasinvestors"}

Power demand is spiking. Classic utilities and heavy grid contractors get most of the airtime, but there is a second lane that sits closer to the bottlenecks: distributed power at the site level. Think microgrids, on-site storage, smarter inverters, and software that arbitrages time, price, and uptime. Here is a clean way to frame it for a general portfolio without turning this into a shopping list.\n\n# A. Microgrids and backup power\n\nIf your thesis includes resilience and faster time-to-power, this is the front line. Generac (GNRC) still sells the standby gear everyone knows, but its commercial and industrial offerings now include turnkey microgrids and batteries aimed at data centers, telecom, and critical sites. It is cyclical, tied to weather and capex cycles, yet it is a real operating business with distribution and service already in place.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) pitches solid oxide fuel cells as always-on behind-the-meter baseload. The hook for AI is uptime: cleaner, firm power that sits next to the racks. The debate is cost curves and durability, but the product is positioned squarely at high-availability loads.\n\nFluence (FLNC) is storage hardware plus software at utility and developer scale. It is not a science project. It lives where renewables and peak management meet. The tie-in to AI is simple: higher 24x7 loads force grids to flex more often, and storage is the flex.\n\nEnerSys (ENS) often gets overlooked as an industrial battery name, yet it supplies storage for telecom, microgrids, and critical backup. It is less sexy than a greenfield microgrid developer, more embedded in the places that cannot go dark.\n\nNextNRG (NХXT) sits way out on the risk curve. The pitch is mobile fueling plus AI-managed microgrids and charging behind a software layer they call a utility OS. Fast Growth, but. It is ultra small, en-route to profitability, and quite promotiaonal. If you track it at all, treat it as a satellite exposure to the same resilience theme, not a proxy for the category.\n\n# B. Solar developers, inverters, distributed solar\n\nThis lane is less about baseload next to a data hall and more about the distributed fabric that lightens grid stress. Enphase (ENPH) and SolarEdge (SEDG) push power electronics, storage, and controls into rooftops and small commercial. When virtual power plants scale, these endpoints become dispatchable capacity.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) is utility-scale modules rather than microgrids, but it supplies the renewable capacity that underwrites long-term power purchase agreements. If hyperscalers keep signing large PPAs, someone has to build those megawatts.\n\nSunrun (RUN) and Sunnova (NOVA) are residential solar and storage with growing VPP ambitions. If aggregated homes start acting like a peaker plant, this layer becomes more important to stability and price.\n\n# C. Storage and flexibility software\n\nSTEM packages storage hardware with optimization software and virtual power plant orchestration. It sits at the junction of price signals, weather, and load, which is exactly where AI-driven demand forces change first.\n\nAES is a useful bridge name: a utility with significant renewables and storage development, and a strategic link to Fluence. If you prefer a regulated backbone but want exposure to the buildout, this is a hybrid way to think about it.\n\nTesla Energy is not a utility proxy and it carries auto cyclicality, but Megapacks, Autobidder, and VPP pilots are a real presence in grid-scale storage. If you follow the category, ignore the car debate for a second and look at the interconnect queues and project lists on the energy side.\n\n# D. A cleaner structure for the thesis\n\nInstead of one catch-all bucket, separate the stack so you can track cause and effect.\n\n* Core grid and contractors: regulated utilities plus shovels like ETN, PWR, ABB, Siemens, Schneider, Itron, MasTec.\n* Distributed power bucket: the names above grouped by role.\n\n\n\n* Microgrids and backup: GNRC, BE, FLNC, ENS, NХXT.\n* Solar and inverters: ENPH, SEDG, FSLR, RUN, NOVA.\n* Storage and VPP software: STEM, Tesla Energy, and overlap names like FLNC.\n\nNow you can follow the story the way the electrons flow. Data center demand and reliability needs push procurement. Procurement drives on-site solutions and storage. Storage and controls drive software and VPPs. Utility-scale renewables supply the long-dated contracts in the background.\n\nThat is the distributed layer behind the headline AI power trade. It is not a single ticker and it is not a fad. It is a stack. Track it like one.\n\nNot financial advice, own DD required.

The AI Money Loop Is Not Real Demand\n\nBurry highlighted a chart showing the financial relationships between Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, Oracle, AMD, CoreWeave, and many AI startups.\n\nHis point is simple:\n\nAI companies are mostly buying from each other using money that came from each other.\n\nExamples:\n\nMicrosoft invests in OpenAI\n\nOpenAI spends billions on Nvidia chips\n\nNvidia invests in GPU-cloud companies\n\nThose GPU-cloud companies buy more Nvidia chips\n\nOracle signs huge cloud deals with OpenAI\n\nOracle then buys large amounts of Nvidia hardware\n\n\nThis creates a circular economy where revenue appears to grow, but the money never comes from true end customers.\n\nBurry summarized it as:\n\n“True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers.”\n\nThis means the AI industry could be inflating itself without real outside demand.\n\n\n---\n\n2. “Suspicious Revenue Recognition”\n\nBurry warned that many AI companies may be using accounting methods that make their revenue look larger or more stable than it really is.\n\nThis can include:\n\nBooking multi-year deals upfront\n\nUsing credits or internal agreements as revenue\n\nCircular transactions where companies buy from each other\n\n\nHis view is that if every transaction were shown clearly, the financial picture would appear far less impressive.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Misunderstanding GPU Depreciation\n\nAnother tweet targeted the idea that older GPUs retaining high utilization means they retain high economic value.\n\nBurry argued that:\n\nJust because older chips are still being used does not mean they are profitable.\n\nA100 GPUs use two to three times more electricity per compute unit than newer H100 chips.\n\nHigher energy usage means drastically higher operating costs.\n\n\nHe compared it to airlines keeping old airplanes around only for holiday overflow. They still fly, but they don’t make meaningful profit.\n\nMost importantly:\nMany AI companies use GPUs as collateral for loans or SPV financing.\nIf the market realizes these chips are economically inefficient, their value collapses.\n\n\n---\n\n4. The 1969 Buffett Letter Comparison\n\nBurry also posted Warren Buffett’s 1969 partnership-closing letter. In it, Buffett explained that markets were overpriced, speculation was rampant, and quality opportunities had vanished.\n\nWhat followed:\n\nThe S&P 500 fell sharply.\n\nAfter inflation, investors lost more than half their purchasing power over the next decade.\n\n\nBurry is implying that today’s AI-driven market resembles that overheated period.\n\n\n---\n\n5. Nvidia’s Buyback and Share Dilution Problem\n\nBurry ended the week with a critique of Nvidia’s financial engineering.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2025:\n\nNvidia earned about $205 billion in net income.\n\nIt generated $188 billion in free cash flow.\n\nIt spent $112.5 billion on stock buybacks.\n\nYet the total share count increased by 47 million shares.\n\n\nThis means the buybacks did not actually benefit shareholders.\nThey mainly offset dilution from stock-based compensation.\n\nAccording to Burry, the real economic cost to shareholders was: $112.5 billion lost\nand\nowner earnings reduced by roughly half\nbecause of how the compensation and buyback cycle worked.\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nAcross all his tweets, Burry’s message is consistent:\n\nAI demand is largely circular, not organic.\n\nRevenue recognition practices may be hiding weakness.\n\nGPU economics are misunderstood and potentially overstated.\n\nThe market resembles past speculative peaks.\n\nEven Nvidia’s financials show signs of late-cycle strain.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 93, "over_18": false, "author": "Raymond5792"}
