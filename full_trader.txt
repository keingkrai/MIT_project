Okay, I have reviewed the comprehensive analysis and the proposed investment plan for AAPL. The plan's emphasis on risk management, particularly the overbought RSI and the uncertainties surrounding AI leadership and regulatory challenges, is well-reasoned. The proposed stop-loss order and the three-month reassessment period are prudent measures. The plan demonstrates a clear understanding of the need to balance potential gains with potential risks, a valuable lesson learned from past trading experiences.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
