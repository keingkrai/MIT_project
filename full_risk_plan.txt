Section 1 Final Verdict
SELL.

Section 2 Risk Rationale
The Safe Analyst provided the most convincing argument. While the momentum and sentiment are undeniably strong, as highlighted by the Risky and Neutral Analysts, the core risk of an exceptionally high Price to Earnings Ratio of 38.31 cannot be ignored. The Safe Analyst correctly identified that this valuation leaves the stock highly vulnerable to any negative catalyst or a slowdown in anticipated growth. The potential for significant downside risk outweighs the speculative upside presented by the bullish arguments. The elevated valuation, coupled with the Relative Strength Index approaching overbought territory, presents a clear signal for capital preservation over chasing further gains.
