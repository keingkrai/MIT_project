### 1.Trade Setup (The Action)
- **Strategy:** Neutral Hold - Monitoring for Catalysts
- **Action:** WAIT
- **Timeframe:** Swing Trade / Short-Term Monitoring

### 2.Key Levels (The Numbers)
- **Entry Zone:** N/A - Current position being held.
- **Stop Loss:** N/A - No new entry, therefore no stop loss. Existing stop loss levels should be maintained if applicable.
- **Target/Take Profit:** N/A - No new entry.

### 3.Position Sizing
- **Proposed Size:** Maintain current position size.
- **Risk Rationale:** The plan suggests a "Hold" due to overbought conditions and lack of catalysts. Maintaining the current position size reflects a neutral stance and avoids adding risk in an uncertain environment.

### 4.Trader's Note
- Monitor RSI, MACD, and news catalysts closely. Re-evaluate the position based on future developments and indicator shifts. Consider reducing exposure if negative catalysts emerge or if the overbought condition persists without a significant price correction.
